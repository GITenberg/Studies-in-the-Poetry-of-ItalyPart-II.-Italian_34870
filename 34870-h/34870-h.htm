<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In writing this book the author has endeavored to give a connected story
of the development of Italian literature from its origin down to the
present. In so doing, however, he has laid chief stress on those writers
whose fame is world-wide, and thus, owing to lack of space, has been
obliged to treat in the briefest manner those writers who, although
famous in Italy itself, are not generally known to the world at large.
It is hoped that the reader may be led to study more in detail this
literature, which although ranking with the greatest of the
world-literatures, has been to a large degree neglected in England and
America. The translations from Dante's New Life and of the story from
Boccaccio have been made by the author, inasmuch as during the writing
of this book he could not obtain access to the standard translations.</p>

<p>It is to be noted also, that owing to unavoidable delay in the
transmission of the manuscript, the author has not been able to read the
proof.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">THE ORIGINS OF ITALIAN LITERATURE</p>


<p>The first thing that strikes the attention of the student of Italian
literature is its comparatively recent origin. In the north and south of
France the Old French and Provençal languages had begun to develop a
literature before the tenth century, which by the end of the twelfth had
risen to a high degree of cultivation; indeed, by that time the
Provençal had attained its highest point, and had already begun to
decline. In Italy, however, we cannot trace the beginning of a
literature, properly so-called, farther back than the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>Among the various causes which may be assigned for this phenomenon, the
most important undoubtedly is the fact that the Italians have always
looked upon themselves as of one race with the ancient Romans, and the
heirs of all the glorious traditions attached to the names of the
heroes, poets, and artists of the Eternal City. In similar manner they
regarded Latin as their true mother-tongue, of which the vernacular was
a mere corruption. Hence it came to pass that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> all the literature which
we find in Italy before the thirteenth century, and a large proportion
of that written in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries,
was in Latin and not in Italian, which seemed to the writers of those
days unworthy of forming the medium of poetry and learning.</p>

<p>This feeling of kinship was a natural one for those who lived in the
same cities in which the Romans had lived, surrounded by the imposing
ruins of the ancient world, speaking a language, which although
essentially a modern one, with all its characteristics, was still nearer
to Latin than French, Provençal, or Spanish. For these men the
irruptions of the northern barbarians, the Goths, the Lombards, and
later the Normans, were only a break in the continuity of the historical
development of the Latin race in Italy. This spirit&mdash;which explains the
popularity and temporary success of Arnold of Brescia, in the twelfth
century, and of Cola di Rienzi, in the fourteenth, in their efforts to
restore the old forms of the Roman republic&mdash;must be kept constantly in
mind by the student, not only of the political history of Italy, but of
its literature and art as well.</p>

<p>Yet this natural feeling does not rest altogether on fact. The Italians
of to-day are not the pure descendants of the ancient Romans, but, like
the other so-called Latin races, are of mixed origin, more nearly
related, it is true, to the Romans, yet in general formed in the same
ethnical way as their neighbors.</p>

<p>With the downfall of Rome, Italy, like France and Spain, was overrun by
the hordes of German tribes, who, leaving the cold and inhospitable
regions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> North sought for more congenial climes in the sunny
South. As the Franks in France, the Visigoths and Vandals in Spain, so
the Ostrogoths in Italy, toward the end of the fifth century, conquered
and colonized the country, and under Theodoric restored for a brief time
an appearance of prosperity. In the sixth century came the Lombards, and
after destroying and devastating city and country as far south as Rome,
and even beyond, finally settled in upper Italy now known from them as
Lombardy. Several centuries later came the Normans from France and
conquered Sicily and the southern extremity of the peninsula. All these
peoples were of German origin, and being gradually merged with the
conquered race, formed what we now call the Italian people.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It goes without saying that the Latin language was profoundly affected
by all these changes. Although the German invaders gradually adopted the
civilization of the conquered land, including the language, yet they
could not help influencing this civilization and impressing it with
their own individual stamp.</p>

<p>With regard to the language, we must bear in mind that even in the time
of Vergil and Cicero, Latin had two forms, one the elegant and
artificial language of literature, and the other the idiom of the common
people, or the vernacular. Many of the peculiar phonetic, grammatical,
and syntactical phenomena which characterize the modern Romance
languages existed in this so-called "vulgar Latin," long before the fall
of Rome, the irruption of the northern barbarians, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> the consequent
formation of new nations and new tongues.</p>

<p>All the Romance languages have been derived from this "vulgar Latin,"
each one being specially moulded by its peculiar environments, and by
the various German, Celtic, and other dialects by which it was
influenced. Thus the "vulgar Latin" imported by Roman colonists into
Gaul, and influenced by the Franks, produced the French language: in the
same way "vulgar Latin" plus the various local and foreign influences to
which it was subjected in Italy, produced the various dialects of that
country&mdash;Venetian, Tuscan, Neapolitan, and Sicilian. While literary
Latin, although becoming more and more corrupt as the years went by,
continued in Italy to be the language of the church, of the courts of
law, and of what literature there was, the vernacular&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the
various dialects&mdash;was used in all the operations of daily life.</p>

<p>We have evidence that this popular tongue must have been in existence as
far back as the seventh century, for in Latin public documents dating
from that period on, we find occasional words and fragments of phrases,
especially the names of persons and places, which are marked by the
special characteristics of the Italian language. These expressions,
embedded in the Latin documents, like pebbles in sand, become more and
more numerous as we approach the tenth century, until finally, in the
year 960, we meet for the first time with a complete Italian sentence,
in a legal document concerning the boundaries of a certain piece of
property in Capua; four years later we find almost the same formula in a
similar document. Toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> end of the eleventh century certain
frescoes were painted in the lower church of Saint Clement in Rome,
where they may still be seen, and among them is one beneath which is
found an explanation in Italian.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact, however, that these monuments of early Italian
increase from year to year, they were not numerous before the thirteenth
century. The very scarcity of them shows the tenacity with which the
people clung to the traditions of Rome, since not only literature, but
even public and private documents were written in Latin. This literary
tradition never wholly died out in Italy, even in the darkest days of
her history. It is true that in the terrible disorders that accompanied
the slow agony of dying Rome, a long period of darkness and ignorance
occurred. The empire was split into two parts and the seat of the
emperor was transferred to Constantinople; the Goths and Lombards
conquered Northern Italy, the Saracens and Normans the South. All
through the Dark Ages Italy was the prey of foreign marauders; the
Huns&mdash;those scourges of the nations&mdash;came as far as Rome; the Arabs
obtained a foothold in Sicily, scoured the seas, and even ravaged the
Campagna up to the very walls of the Eternal City.</p>

<p>Not only did devoted Italy suffer from outsiders, but discord and civil
conflicts rent her very entrails. When Charlemagne was crowned emperor
in 800 by Leo III., as a reward for having defended Rome against the
incursions of the Lombards, it was thought that the reëstablishment of
the Roman empire would bring in a new era of peace and glory. With the
death of the great king, however, anarchy once more reigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> supreme.
His successors in the empire (for the most part weaklings) were kept
busy with the affairs of Germany, and regarded Italy, "the garden of the
empire," as Dante calls it, with indifference. In Italy itself there was
no such thing as patriotism or feeling of national unity. The people
were oppressed by the nobles, who themselves were in a continual state
of warfare with each other. In the eleventh century a new power arose in
the form of free cities, chief among them being Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and
Florence. These, however, only increased the disorder which already
existed; city fought with city, and even within the same walls the
various families formed parties and feuds, which led to incessant
strife, of which murder, rapine, and arson were the usual concomitants.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that in the midst of all this anarchy and confusion
Roman civilization almost died out. What the barbarians had spared, the
church itself tried to destroy. Having finally triumphed over pagan
Rome, it fought pagan civilization; the early Christian fathers looked
upon art and literature as the work of demons; the clergy were forbidden
to read the classic writers except for grammatical purposes, the subject
matter being deemed poisonous to the souls of Christians. Even so great
a man as Pope Gregory despised classical antiquity. During the long
period when Italy was the prey of Saracen and Hun, when pestilence and
famine stalked gauntly through the desolated land, civilization sank to
its lowest point. Superstition and asceticism held full sway in
religion; men sought relief from the sufferings of the life that now is
in the contemplation of a new and happier state in the life to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> come.
Hence arose the widespread conviction that God is best pleased with
those who despise this life, with all its beauty and pleasure, its pride
and glory, its pomp and power.</p>

<p>In spite of this apparent death, however, a spark of life still existed.
Through all this dolorous period, schools could be found, in which a
half-barbarous Latin was rudely taught, as being the language of the
church. There never was a time when Latin authors were not read to some
extent in school and monastery.</p>

<p>With the eleventh century a change for the better began in the
intellectual, as well as in the political life of Italy. The rise of
cities, the crusades, even the unholy contest between pope and emperor
gave new impulse to the minds of all, and led to the beginning of a new
era. The defeat of the German emperors, through papal intrigue, added to
the power of the free cities, which were thus made independent of
trans-Alpine over-lordship, and now began to enter upon that long career
of prosperity and intellectual conquest which is the wonder of the
student of the history of medieval Italy.</p>

<p>This intellectual movement of the eleventh century, which gave a new and
strong impulse to the study of philosophy and theology, resulted in a
rich literature in these departments of learning. Peter Damian, the
right hand of Gregory VII. in his war with the emperors, became a leader
in the study of philosophy and wrote many celebrated works. Other
Italian philosophers and theologians&mdash;Lanfranc, Anselm, and Peter
Lombard&mdash;taught in foreign schools. In the thirteenth century Italy
produced two of the greatest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> medieval philosophers, St. Thomas
Aquinas and St. Bonaventura. Later the newly founded University of
Bologna became the center of an eager study of law, which resulted in
the writing of many books on jurisprudence.</p>

<p>This late and artificial bloom of Latin literature in theology and
philosophy brought the necessity of a more satisfactory study of the
Latin language itself. Hence arose many new grammars, rhetorics, and
texts. In a similar manner the newly awakened interest in science (such
as it was) brought in a new class of books, corresponding to our modern
encyclopedias. From the twelfth century on, all over Europe, large
numbers of these compendiums were compiled, containing a summary of all
the knowledge of the times; chief among these encyclopedias was the vast
<i>Speculum Majus</i> (the Greater Mirror) of Vincent of Beauvais, containing
82 books and 9,905 chapters. Very popular, also, were the moral and
didactic treatises. Symbolism took possession of all literature. The
phenomena of nature became types of religious life&mdash;even the writings of
pagan antiquity were treated symbolically and made to reveal prophecies
of Christian doctrine; Vergil, in a famous passage, was supposed to have
foretold the coming of the Savior, and even the <i>Ars Amatoria</i> of Ovid,
"of the earth earthy," if ever poem was, was interpreted in terms of
Christian mysticism.</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned literature, however, so far as it existed in
Italy before the thirteenth century, was written in Latin; we must
dismiss it, therefore, with this brief mention, and pass on to the true
subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> this book, Italian literature properly so-called, which, as
we have already seen, cannot be said to have existed before the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>One feature which is largely characteristic of all subsequent periods of
Italian literature marks the formative period thereof, that is, the
comparative lack of invention and originality, and the spirit of
imitation of other literatures, distant either in time or space. In
order to trace its early beginnings to their sources, we must go outside
the borders of Italy. For nearly two hundred years the south of France
had been the home of a large number of elegant lyrical poets, whose fame
and influence had spread over all Europe. These troubadours, as they
were called, were welcomed not only at the courts of princes and nobles
in Provence, but were likewise honored guests in Northern France, in
Spain, and in Italy. The latter country had long been closely connected
with Southern France by means of commerce and politics. Hence it was
natural for the troubadours to seek the rewards of their art in the
brilliant courts of Italy. Toward the end of the twelfth century some of
the best known of them, among them the famous Pierre Vidal and Rambaud
de Vaqueiras, made their way thither. After the terrible crusades
against the Albigenses&mdash;which not only cruelly slaughtered tens of
thousands of earnest Christians, but likewise destroyed forever the
independence and prosperity of Provence, and thus, by destroying the
courts of noble families, put a sudden stop to the flourishing
literature&mdash;large numbers of the wandering minstrels came to Northern
Italy.</p>

<p>It was not long before their influence began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> manifest itself, first
in Northern Italy, and later in the south and center. The north Italian
poets began to imitate the troubadours, and soon a considerable body of
poetry had been composed by native poets, in the manner and&mdash;a
phenomenon worthy of note&mdash;in the language itself of the Provençal
poets. This is due to the relationship between the dialects of Northern
Italy and the Provençal, and also to the fact that at that time the
latter tongue was far more elegant and cultivated than the other Romance
languages. This north Italian poetry is always included in the Provençal
collections and the writers are known as troubadours in spite of their
Italian nationality. Among the most famous are Bartolomeo Zorzi of
Venice, Bonifaccio Calvo of Genoa, and especially Sordello of Mantua,
praised by Dante in a famous passage of the Purgatory, and the subject
of Browning's well-known poem.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the above poets belong rather to the history of
Provençal than that of Italian literature. To find the first springs of
national poetry in Italy, we must traverse the whole length of the
peninsula and arrive at the court of Frederick II. (1194-1250) in
Sicily, which at this time was far ahead of the rest of the country in
civilization, art, and literature. Frederick himself was a many-sided
man, warrior, statesman, lawyer, and scholar, and stands out among his
contemporaries, especially in matters of religious tolerance. He
welcomed to his court not only the scholars, poets, and artists of
Europe, but likewise Arabs, who were at that time in possession of a
high degree of culture. He caused many Greek and Arab authors to be
translated into Latin, among them Aristotle; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> founded the University
of Naples; above all, by his own mighty personality, he made a deep
impression on the times.</p>

<p>Frederick's ministers were, like himself, men of culture and learning.
Chief among them was Pier delle Vigne, statesman and poet, the cause of
whose tragic death by his own hand is told by Dante in the Inferno.</p>

<p>The influence of the troubadours made itself felt in Sicily about the
same time as in Northern Italy, only here the imitation was in the
Italian language and not in Provençal. Among the early Sicilian poets
who wrote after the manner of the troubadours, was the Emperor Frederick
II. himself, his son, Enzio, and Pier delle Vigne. From an æsthetic
point of view, this early indigenous poetry is of little interest, but
as the beginning of a movement which culminated in the New Life and
Divine Comedy of Dante, it is of very great importance.</p>

<p>It had no originality or freshness, but was a slavish imitation of
Provençal models, the conventions of which were transported bodily,
without any change, except to be poorer. Love was the only theme, and
the type always remains the same. The lover is humble, a feudal vassal
of his lady who stands far above him, all beauty and virtue, but a cold
and lifeless abstraction. She usually treats her lover with disdain or
indifference, while he pours forth the protestations of his love, extols
her beauty, and laments her hardness of heart. All these things,
repeated countless times, in almost the same language, became monotonous
in the Provençal poets, and naturally much more so in their Italian
imitators.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>This Sicilian school of poetry did not last long; it perished with the
downfall of the Hohenstaufens. It found a continuation, however, in
middle Italy, especially in the province of Tuscany, which, from this
time on, becomes the center of the literary and artistic life of Italy.
The poetry of the court of Frederick had not been written in the
Sicilian dialect, but in a sort of court language not very dissimilar to
the Tuscan. It is probable that among the poets of the Sicilian school
some were Tuscans, and that after the death of Frederick they returned
home, bringing with them the poetical doctrines which they had learned.</p>

<p>However this may be, we find a direct continuation of the movement in
Tuscany. We see the same slavish imitation of the troubadours, the same
ideas, and the same poetical language and tricks of style. In addition
to the influence of the Sicilian school, there was a direct imitation of
the Provençal poets; thus Guittone d'Arezzo, the leader of the early
Tuscan school, wrote and spoke Provençal, and Dante, in his Purgatory,
introduces the Troubadour Arnaut Daniel, speaking in his native tongue.</p>

<p>One phase of Provençal poetry&mdash;the political&mdash;strangely enough
considering the stormy times, had not been imitated by the poets at the
court of Frederick II. From the first, however, the Tuscans included
politics in their poetry, and one of the strongest of Guittone's poems
is a song on the battle of Montaperti (1260).</p>

<p>Guittone d'Arezzo is the direct literary ancestor of Dante, and the
first original Italian poet. Hence he deserves a word or two even in
this brief sketch. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> was born in 1230 near Arezzo in Tuscany, hence
his name; after a youth spent in the pursuit of pleasure, he was
converted, and looking on all things earthly as mere vanities, he left
his wife and family and joined the recently founded military-religious
order of the Knights of Saint Mary. He died at Florence in 1294. In
early life he had been gay and dissipated; his last years he spent in
the exercises of religious asceticism. These two parts of his life
correspond to two phases of his poetry. In the first he was a follower
of the Sicilian school and wrote love poetry; in the second he discarded
this "foolishness" and wrote political, moral, and theological
discussions in verse. His poetry has little esthetic value, but is
important as forming a transition between the early Sicilian school and
the group of poets whose greatest member was Dante. His writings against
earthly love and his praise of heavenly love mark an important change in
the development of Italian poetry and open the path which leads up to
Beatrice and the Divine Comedy.</p>

<p>The next important step in this progress is marked by Guido Guinicelli,
a learned lawyer and judge of Bologna (situated in the province of
Romagna and separated from Tuscany by the Apennines), a city which at
that time was the seat of a flourishing university and the center of a
keen intellectual life.</p>

<p>Guinicelli was born in 1220, was prominent in political as well as in
literary circles, was banished in 1274, and died in 1276. He was a
follower of Guittone, and like him his first poetry was in the manner of
the Sicilian school. He changed later and began a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> school, the
<i>dolce stile nuova</i>, as Dante calls it. The change shows itself
especially in the new conception of love, and of its origin, growth, and
effects. The troubadours and their Sicilian imitators declared that love
came from seeing, that it entered through the eyes of the beholder, and
thence descended to the heart. Guinicelli says, on the contrary, that
love does not come from without, but dwells, "as a bird in its nest," in
the heart and is an attribute thereof. This is not true, however, of all
men, but only of those who are virtuous and good. Only the gentle heart
can love, and a noble character is not the effect of love, but its
cause. These sentiments are expressed in the following lines, translated
by Rossetti:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As birds within the green shade of the grove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love was not, or the gentle heart ere Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For with the sun, at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So sprang the light immediately, nor was<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Its birth before the sun's.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Love hath its effect in gentleness<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of very self; even as<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within the middle fire the heat's excess."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereas the love of the troubadours was romantic and chivalrous, the
love of Guinicelli was intellectual and philosophical. With him earthly
affections become purified and spiritualized. The old repertory of
conventional expressions is gradually discarded, and new forms take
their place, soon to become conventional in their turn. Love and the
poet's Lady remain abstract, but have now a different signification. The
Lady is still treated as a perfect being, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> becomes now a symbol
of something higher. Love for her leads to virtue and to God; poetry now
receives an allegorical character, and its real end becomes the
inculcation of philosophical truth under the veil of earthly love. The
importance of Guinicelli for us is his influence on Dante, for the new
school was not continued in Bologna, but found its chief followers in
Florence. We are thus led naturally up to the works of the great
Florentine poet whom we shall study in the next two chapters.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we must cast a brief glance at certain other
early phases of Italian literature, which later developed into important
branches of poetry and prose.</p>

<p>Northern Italy, as we have seen, had no share in beginning an indigenous
lyrical poetry. It did, however, have an early literature of its own, in
the form of religious and didactic poetry, for the most part
translations from Latin and French originals. In Umbria, the home of St.
Francis, and the center of those waves of religious excitement which so
profoundly affected Italy in the thirteenth century, a popular religious
lyric arose. St. Francis himself deserves some mention in literary
history, if only on account of his famous song of praise, which he
instructed his followers to sing as they wandered, like spiritual
troubadours, through the land. St. Francis was no mere ascetic, but
loved the beauty of nature and had a tender love for all creatures.
Quaintly enough he was wont to call birds and animals, and even
inanimate objects, such as the sun and moon, by the name of brother and
sister.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> his followers was Thomas of Celano, who wrote that
most solemn and majestic of all Latin hymns, "Dies Iræ."</p>

<p>The astonishing popularity and spread of the new order founded by St.
Francis can only be explained by the terrible sufferings of the times.
All Italy was stirred by deep religious excitement. In 1233, the
movement reached its high-water mark. Old and young, high and low,
leaving their ordinary occupations and business, marched in processions
through the land singing pious songs; the country folk streamed to the
cities to hear the sermons which were given morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p>About the year 1260, a similar movement started, that of the
Flagellants, so called from their custom of carrying whips with which
they lashed themselves in token of repentance. The times were dark and
stormy, the never-ending feuds between the papal and imperial parties
brought in their train murder and rapine, while famine and pestilence
stalked through the land. Suddenly a priest, named Fasani, appeared in
Perugia, who said he had been sent by heaven to prophesy terrible
punishments on a sinful world. Once more the processions began, and the
aroused and penitent multitudes moved through the land, lashing
themselves with whips and singing pious songs.</p>

<p>The literary effect of all this religious excitement was far-reaching,
especially important for us in that it prepared the way for Dante, not
only by creating the proper atmosphere, but by the production of hymns
and visionary journeys into the unseen world. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> religious lyrics or
hymns, which the multitudes sang, were known as <i>Laudi</i>, or songs of
praise. They were not the artificial imitation of foreign poets, like
the early Sicilian and Tuscan poetry, but the genuine product of the
soil. They were composed for and sung by the great mass of the people
who could not understand Latin. They were spread far and wide and made
popular by the Flagellants, and thus became true folk-songs.</p>

<p>The most famous of the writers of these <i>Laudi</i> in the thirteenth
century was Jacopone da Todi, the story of whose conversion is extremely
touching. He was a rich young lawyer of Florence, full of the pride of
life. At a certain festivity his wife was killed by an accident, and
under her costly garments was found, next to her skin, a hair-shirt,
such as was worn by penitents. The tragic death of his wife and this
evidence of her religious feelings converted the once proud Jacopone,
who joined a religious order and devoted the rest of his life to the
service of God. Besides being the author of a number of <i>Laudi</i> and
religious poems, he probably wrote the famous Latin hymn, <i>Stabat
Mater</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Laudi</i>, beginning in the thirteenth century, lasted down to the
sixteenth century. As an example of them we give here the following
stanzas, written by Girolamo Benivieni (1453-1542), and translated by
John Addington Symonds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus, whoso with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs not in pain and loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced on the cruel cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At peace can never be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lord, unto me be kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me that peace of mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in the world so blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And false, dwells but with thee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here in my heart be lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fire to feed on it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till burning bit by bit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It dies to live with thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before we close this chapter we must say a word or two concerning
another branch of early literature, whose influence is not great on
Dante or his immediate successors, but which was destined to bloom forth
later in a new kind of poetry, which has become the peculiar glory of
Italy. The introduction into Italy of the French national heroic epic
(the <i>chansons de geste</i>) began about the same time as the introduction
of the Provençal lyric. In Northern Italy these romances were not only
read but imitated, and about the second half of the thirteenth century,
arose a mongrel sort of literature, written in a language, half French,
half Italian. The most popular of these poems were those dealing with
Charlemagne, who, as the protector of the pope and the restorer of the
Roman empire, was looked upon by the Italians as one of their own race.
These old <i>chansons de geste</i>, however, in coming to Italy, lost much of
their original significance. The spirit and ideals could scarcely be
understood by the Italians, to whom feudal society was largely unknown.
What they liked in the French romances was not religious or patriotic
sentiments, but adventures and the wonderful deeds of the heroes. The
object, then, of the rude early writers of the Franco-Italian epic was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
to interest the hearers and arouse curiosity. Hence these poems became
monopolized by wandering minstrels, who sang in the streets and public
squares to the people who gathered about them, much as their descendants
gather about the Punch and Judy shows and the wandering musicians of
to-day. For nearly two hundred years the French romances existed in
Italy in this humble state, until, as we shall see later, they were
incorporated into regular literature by Pulci, Boiardo, and Ariosto.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">DANTE: LIFE AND MINOR WORKS</p>


<p>In the preceding chapter we have outlined the development of early
Italian poetry, endeavoring to show how from the Sicilian school it was
carried over to Tuscany; how Guido Guinicelli, in Bologna, had
transformed it from a slavish imitation of the troubadours into a new
school of symbolical philosophical poetry, and finally, how from Bologna
the new doctrines spread to Florence.</p>

<p>There were a number of early poets of Florence and other Tuscan cities
who wrote in the manner of Guido Guinicelli, among the best known being
Cino da Pistoia, Lapo Gianni, Dante da Majano, and especially worthy of
note, Guido Cavalcanti. The latter, who was the intimate friend of
Dante, was a member of a noble family, and was prominent in all the
intellectual and political life of Florence. He was among those who were
exiled from the city in 1300, and died soon after his return in the same
year. Dante refers to him in the New Life as the "first of his friends,"
and records in the Inferno a pathetic interview with his father in the
city of Dis. To him and a mutual friend, Lapo, he addressed the
following beautiful sonnet, so well translated by Shelley:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guido, I would that Lapo, thou and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by some strong enchantment, might ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A magic ship, whose charmèd sails should fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that no change, nor any evil chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should mar our joyous voyage; but it might be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That even satiety should still enhance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between our hearts their strict community:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the bounteous wizard then would place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanna and Bice and my gentle love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companions of our wandering, and would grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With passionate talk, wherever we might rove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our time, and each were as content and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I believe that thou and I should be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a sample of Guido Cavalcanti's own poetical skill we may take the
following sonnet, translated by Cary:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whatso is fair in lady's face or mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gentle knights caparison'd and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing of sweet birds unto love inclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gallant barks that cut the watery way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white snow falling without any wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cloudless sky at break of early day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crystal stream, with flowers the meadow lined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Silver, and gold, and azure for array:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him that sees the beauty and the worth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose power doth meet and in my lady dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All seem as vile, their price and lustre gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the heaven is higher than the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So she in knowledge doth each one excel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not slow to good in nature like her own.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is with Dante alone, however, that we can busy ourselves here, for in
him are summed up all the various tendencies and characteristics of his
predecessors and contemporaries.</p>

<p>The figure of Dante Alighieri is one of the saddest in literary history;
his life seemed to contain all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> sorrow that can fall to the lot of
humankind. An exile from his native city, separated from family and
friends, deprived of his property, and thus forced to live in poverty or
become the recipient of charity, disappointed in his patriotic hopes,
the only thing left him to do was to turn his eyes inward and to build
up out of his very sufferings and sorrow, his immortal poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! from what agony of heart and brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What exultations trampling on despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Uprose this poem of the earth and air,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This medieval miracle of song."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We see, then, that even more important than in the case of other poets
is some knowledge of the great Florentine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have not a reliable and complete record of that life.
Legend and fancy have been interwoven with facts so closely that often
it is hard to separate one from the other. The following data, however,
are well established. Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in the year
1265, the day and month being uncertain, but probably falling between
May 18th and June 17th. He belonged to a family which was counted among
the lesser nobility. Dante himself does not seem to have been able to
trace his ancestry further back than four generations. In the fifteenth
canto of Paradise there is a famous passage where the poet tells how he
meets in Mars his great-grandfather, Cacciaguida, who gives him certain
autobiographical details: That he was baptized at the church of San
Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> in Florence; that he had two brothers; that his wife came from
the Po valley (whence originated the name Alighieri); that he had gone
on the crusades with the Emperor Conrad, by whom he had been dubbed
knight, and finally, that he had been killed by the Arabs. This is all
Dante knew, for he makes Cacciaguida say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"They, of whom I sprang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, had there our birthplace,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, in a certain quarter of Florence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Thus much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffice of my forefathers; who they were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whence they hither came, more honorable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is to pass in silence than to tell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Dante's immediate family we know little. Strangely enough for one who
reveals himself so completely in his poetry, he says nothing of either
father or mother. As to his education we can only infer it from his
works and the condition of the times. The statements made by Boccaccio
and Villani concerning his early school life, are fables. He did not go
to school under Brunetto Latini, for the latter had no school; although
Dante was undoubtedly influenced by Latini's <i>Trésor</i> (a vast
encyclopedical compilation of contemporary knowledge) which laid the
foundations of the poet's learning. Moreover, it may well be that the
distinguished statesman, judge, and writer directed by his personal
counsel the studies of the bright young scholar, for whom he prophesied
a brilliant career. Hence Dante's joy and gratitude at meeting in the
Inferno the "dear paternal image of him who had taught him how man
becomes eternal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certain that Dante studied the regular curriculum of medieval
education, the so-called seven liberal arts, consisting of the
Quadrivium and the Trivium.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He knew Latin, but no Greek; he quotes
frequently Vergil, Horace, Statius, and others. He was a profound
student of philosophy and theology; loved art, music, and poetry. In the
Divine Comedy he shows a wide knowledge, embracing practically all the
science and learning of the times. All this he largely taught himself,
especially in his early life. Later he visited the universities of Padua
and Bologna, and probably Paris. It is quite unlikely that he got as far
as Oxford, as Mr. Gladstone endeavored to prove some years ago. He was
not unacquainted with military life, having been present at the battle
of Campaldino and at the surrender of Caprona.</p>

<p>He was married before 1298 to Gemma Donati, and thus became related to
one of the most powerful families in Florence. Here again he shows a
strange reticence, never mentioning his wife or children. We have no
reason, however, to believe his marriage unhappy, or that he lacked
affection for his children.</p>

<p>It is true that his wife did not follow him in exile, but there was
reason enough for this in his poverty and wandering life. The apotheosis
of Beatrice need not presuppose lack of conjugal affection, for his love
for her was entirely Platonic and became later a mere symbol of the
spiritual life. He had by Gemma several children, two sons, Pietro and
Jacopo, and one daughter, Beatrice; that he had another daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> named
Antonia, is probable, but not certain. His children joined him later in
life in Ravenna.</p>

<p>Of the greatest importance for the understanding of the Divine Comedy is
a knowledge of the political doctrines and public life of Dante. Tuscany
at that time was in a wild and stormy condition. It shared in the
terrible disorders of the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines
(the former supporting the pope, the latter the emperor). It likewise
had private quarrels of its own. The old feudal nobility had been
repressed by the rise of the cities, into which the nobles themselves
had migrated, and where they kept up an incessant series of quarrels
among themselves or with the free citizens. Yet, in spite of this
constant state of warfare, the cities of Tuscany increased in power and
prosperity, especially Florence. We need only remember that at the time
Dante entered public life (1300) an extraordinary activity manifested
itself in all branches of public works; new streets, squares, and
bridges were laid out and built; the foundations of the cathedral had
been laid, and Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio had been begun. Such
extensive works of public improvement presuppose a high degree of
prosperity and culture. The political condition of Florence itself at
this time was something as follows: In 1265, to go back a few years in
order to get the proper perspective, Charles of Anjou, brother of the
king of France, had been called by Pope Urban IV. to Italy to aid him in
the war with the house of Swabia, and through him the mighty imperial
family of the Hohenstaufens, which had counted among its members
Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II., was destroyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> Manfred, the
natural son of Frederick II., was killed at the battle of Beneventum
(1260), and his nephew, the sixteen-year-old Conradin, the last member
of the family, was betrayed into the hands of Charles after the battle
of Tagliacozza and brutally beheaded in the public square of Naples
(1268). It was through Charles of Anjou that the Ghibellines, who having
been banished from Florence in 1258, had returned after the battle of
Montaperti in 1260, were once more driven from the city; and the
Guelphs, that is, the supporters of the pope, were restored to power.</p>

<p>The government was subject to frequent changes, becoming, however, more
and more democratic in character. The decree of Gian della Bella had
declared all nobles ineligible to public office, and granted the right
to govern only to those who belonged to a guild or who exercised a
profession. It was undoubtedly to render himself eligible to office that
Dante joined the guild of physicians. In 1300 he was elected one of the
six priors who ruled the city, for a period of two months only. From
this brief term of office Dante himself dates all his later misfortunes.</p>

<p>At this time, in addition to the two great parties of Guelphs and
Ghibellines, which existed in Florence as in the rest of Italy, there
were in the city two minor parties, which at first had nothing to do
with papal or imperial politics. These parties, known as Whites and
Blacks, came from Pistoia, over which Florence exercised a sort of
protectorate. The rulers of the latter city tried to smooth out the
quarrels of the above local factions of Pistoia, by taking the chiefs of
both parties to themselves; but the quarrels continued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> Florence, and
soon the whole city was drawn into the contest, the Blacks being led by
Corso Donati, and the Whites by the family of the Cerchi.</p>

<p>Pope Boniface VIII., who claimed Tuscany as the heir of the Countess
Matilda, endeavored to take advantage of the state of discord in order
to further his own selfish plans. For this purpose he sent the Cardinal
Acquasparta to Florence, who, failing to accomplish his mission,
excommunicated the recalcitrant city and left it in a rage. At this
juncture the priors, of whom, as we have seen, Dante was one, thought to
still the discord by banishing the leaders of the Whites and Blacks, an
act, however, which only served to bring the hatred of both parties on
the heads of the magistrates.</p>

<p>In 1301 Charles of Valois was called to Florence, ostensibly to pacify
the divided city; he favored the party of the Blacks, however, and let
in Corso Donati, who had been exiled the year before, and for five days
murder, fire, and rapine raged through the streets of the devoted city.
All the Whites who were not slain were exiled and their property
confiscated or destroyed. Among the exiled was Dante. There are several
decrees against him still extant in the archives of Florence. The first
is dated January 27, 1302, and accuses him, with several others, of
extortion, bribery, defalcation of public money, and hostility to the
pope and the church. We need not say that of all these accusations the
latter was alone true. In case the accused did not appear before the
court to answer the charges, they were condemned in contumacy, to pay a
fine of five hundred gold florins; if this was not paid within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> three
days, their property should be confiscated. This decree was followed by
another, on March 10, 1302, in which the same charges were repeated, and
in which Dante, as a delinquent, was declared an outlaw, and condemned
to be burned alive if ever caught within Florentine territory.</p>

<p>Thus begins the poignant story of Dante's exile. We know but few
definite details of that long period of wandering. He himself says, in
his Banquet, that he traveled all over Italy, "a pilgrim, almost a
beggar."</p>

<p>In the seventeenth canto of Paradise Cacciaguida gives a brief summary
of Dante's exile in the form of a prophecy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"Thou shalt leave each thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved most dearly: this is the first shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from the bow of exile. Thou shalt prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How salt the savor is of other's bread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How hard the passage, to descend and climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By other's stairs. But that shall gall thee most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be the worthless and vile company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all ungrateful, impious all, and mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs, and not thine, shall be the crimson'd brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their course shall so evince their brutishness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ladder perch'd, the sacred bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall behold thee with such kind regard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which 'falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forerun the asking."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We see from these lines that Dante first went to Verona, the seat of
Bartolommeo della Scala (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> "great Lombard," whose coat of arms was a
ladder "scala," with an eagle perched upon it). From there he went to
Bologna, thence to Padua, and thence to the Lunigiana. It is about this
time that he is said to have gone to Paris (this is probable), and to
Germany, Flanders, and England; it is not at all probable that he ever
saw the last-mentioned place.</p>

<p>Dante never gave up altogether the hope that he might one day return to
Florence. He yearned all his life for the "beautiful sheep-fold" where
he had lived as a lamb. Yet even this happiness he would not accept at
the price of dishonor. When, in 1312, a general amnesty was proclaimed
by Florence, and he might have returned if he would consent to certain
humiliating conditions, he wrote the following noble words to a friend
in Florence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is not the way of coming home, my father! Yet, if you or
other find one not beneath the fame of Dante and his honor, that
will I gladly pursue. But if by no such way can I enter
Florence, then Florence shall I never enter. And what then! Can
I not behold the sun and the stars from every spot of earth?
Shall I not be able to meditate on the sweetest truths in every
place beneath the sky, unless I make myself ignoble, yea,
ignominious to the people and state of Florence? Nor shall bread
be wanting." </p></div>

<p>A great hope rose above the horizon of his life when Henry VII., of
Luxemburg, came to Italy to restore the ancient power of the empire.
Dante's letters written at this time are couched in exultant, almost
extravagant, language: "Rejoice, Oh! Italy," he cries, "for thy
bridegroom, the comfort of the world, and the glory of the people, the
most merciful Henry, the divine Augustus and Cæsar is hastening hither
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> the wedding feast." His joy and exultation, alas! were doomed to a
speedy end.</p>

<p>In 1312 Henry, who, after the murder of Albert, had been crowned emperor
(in 1309), came to Pisa, thence to Rome. Then, after having in vain
besieged Florence, which had become the leader of the anti-imperial
movement, he retired to Buonconvento, where he died (probably from
poison) August 24, 1313.</p>

<p>With the tragic death of Henry, Dante seems to have given up all hope of
earthly happiness and from now on turned his eyes to heaven, from which
alone he could hope for justice to himself and peace and righteousness
for unhappy Italy. The composition of the Divine Comedy dates from this
period. His final refuge and place of rest was at Ravenna, at the court
of Guido da Polenta, uncle of Francesca da Rimini, whose pathetic story
is quoted in the next chapter. Here, in comparative comfort and peace,
he spent the evening of his life, occupying his time in writing the
Divine Comedy and in occasional journeys in the interest of his patron.
In 1321, while on one of these journeys to Venice, he caught fever and
died on the 13th of September of that year.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes and legends are told of these years of exile. Thus it is
said that while in Verona, as he was walking one day through the
streets, some women saw him and said: "Behold, there is the man who has
been in hell." A beautiful story is told in a letter, doubtful however,
written by Fra Ilario of the Monastery of Santa Croce on Monte Corvo, to
the effect that one day a dust-stained, travel-worn man, carrying a roll
of manuscript under his arm, knocked at the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> of the monastery, and
on being asked what he wanted, answered "pace, pace" (peace, peace).
This legend has been beautifully rendered by Longfellow in the following
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Methinks I see thee stand with pallid cheeks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By Fra Ilario in his diocese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on the convent walls in golden streaks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ascending sunbeams mark the day's decrease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he asks what there the stranger seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy voice along the cloisters whispers 'peace.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dante's character reveals itself in all its phases in his works. His
youth as represented in the New Life was a happy one, filled with ardor
for study, with affection for friends, and with the ecstasy of a pure
and virtuous love. He needed, however, the death of Beatrice, the long
years of exile, and the disappointment of all his hopes to develop that
strong and noble character which the world admires almost as much as his
poetry. He was an enthusiastic student, yet mingled with the affairs of
men; never willingly doing wrong himself, he was unyielding in what he
conceived to be right, and consecrated his consummate powers to the
cause of the noble and the good. His own conscience was clear, and under
this "breastplate," as he calls it, he went steadily on his way. He was
proud of his learning, strong in his opinions, and does not hesitate to
constitute himself the stern judge of all his contemporaries; this in a
lesser man would have seemed presumptuous; in Dante it was only the
prosecution of a solemn and, as he thought, a Godgiven duty. Yet, in
spite of this sternness his heart was soft and tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Like Tennyson's poet, Dante was "dowered with love of love," as well as
"hate of hate and scorn of scorn."</p>

<p>Those who read only the Inferno, may get the impression of a savage,
revengeful spirit, but the Purgatory and Paradise are full of tenderest
poetry of sublimest imagination, and show their author to have had a
heart full of love and gentleness, sweetness and light. A deep
melancholy weighed over the whole later life of Dante; his heart never
ceased to long for home and friends, yet this melancholy is not
pessimism; he never lost his confidence in God, never doubted right
would win.</p>

<p>It is this inspiring combination of noble qualities in Dante's
character, reflected in every page of the Divine Comedy, which makes the
study of the latter not merely an æsthetic pleasure, but a spiritual
exercise, ennobling and uplifting the minds of those who read it with
the "spirit and with the understanding also."</p>

<p>The works of Dante are not many. They consist of prose and poetry, the
former comprising the so-called Banquet (Convito) and the essay on
Universal Monarchy. The former was to have been finished in fifteen
books or chapters, but is only a fragment of four. It is a sort of
encyclopedia of knowledge, such as were so popular in the Middle Ages,
but written in Italian, in order to bring it within the reach of the
unlearned reader. It is full of the scholastic learning of the times,
and while not attractive to the ordinary reader, is of great importance
for a complete understanding of the Divine Comedy. Likewise important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in this respect is the political treatise on the Monarchy, in which
Dante sums up his theory of world-politics. This book, written in Latin,
is divided into three parts: in Book I., the author shows the necessity
of a universal empire; in Book II., he shows the right of Rome to be the
seat of this empire; in Book III., he shows the independence of the
emperor from the pope. This theory of the separation of the church and
state runs like a thread through the whole of the Divine Comedy, in
which Dante constantly attributes the sufferings of Italy to the lust
for temporal power on the part of the pope and clergy.</p>

<p>For the general reader, however, the most interesting of Dante's
writings, after the Divine Comedy, is the New Life, a strange and
beautiful little book which serves as a prologue to the Divine Comedy.
It is the story of Dante's love for Beatrice Portinari, the daughter of
Folco, a neighbor and friend of the poet's father. It is a simple story,
containing but few actual events, the details consisting for the most
part of repetitions of the theory of love propounded by Guido
Guinicelli, of analyses of Dante's own state of mind, and of mystical
visions. The form of the book is peculiar, part prose, part poetry, the
latter being accompanied by a brief commentary. Yet there is a truth and
sincerity in the book which prove that it is no mere allegory or symbol,
but the record of an actual love on the part of Dante for the fair young
Florentine girl who is its heroine.</p>

<p>Dante tells us in quaint and scholastic language how he first saw
Beatrice at a May festival, when she was at the beginning of her ninth
year and he was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> the end of his. She was dressed in red, with
ornaments suited to her youthful age, and was so beautiful "that surely
one could say of her the words of the poet, Homer: 'She seemed not the
daughter of mortal man but of God.'" He tells us, further, how he felt
the spirit of love awaken within him and how, after that first meeting,
he sought every opportunity of seeing her again.</p>

<p>Nine years later, again in May, he records another occasion when he met
Beatrice, this time dressed in white and accompanied by two ladies, "and
passing along the street she turned her eyes toward the place where I
stood, very timid, and through her ineffable courtesy she gently saluted
me, so that it seemed to me that I experienced all the depths of bliss.
The hour was precisely the ninth of that day, and inasmuch as it was the
first time that her words reached my ears, such sweetness came upon me
that, intoxicated, as it were, with joy, I left the people and went to
my solitary chamber, and began to muse upon this most courteous lady."
This love, accompanied as it was with violent alternations of joy and
sorrow, produced a strong effect on Dante; his health suffered, his
nerves were shattered, and he became frail and weak. Yet he refused to
tell her name, although he confessed that love was the cause of his
sufferings: "And when they asked me by means of whom love brought me to
this wretched state, I looked at them with a smile, but said nothing."</p>

<p>In order, however, to put people on the wrong track, he pretended to
love another lady, and so successful was this subterfuge, that even
Beatrice herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> believed it, so that one day, meeting Dante, she
refused to salute him, an act which filled him with deepest affliction:
"Now after my happiness was denied me, there came upon me so much grief
that leaving all people I went my way to a solitary place to bathe the
earth with bitterest tears; and when I was somewhat relieved by this
weeping, I entered my chamber where I could lament without being heard.
And there I began to call on my lady for mercy, and saying: 'Love, help
thy faithful one,' I fell asleep in tears like a little, beaten child."</p>

<p>As we have already said, there is little action in this book, only a few
meetings in the street, in church, or at funerals; even the death of
Beatrice's father is spoken of vaguely and allusively. The importance of
all lies in the psychological analysis of feelings and thoughts of the
poet. The descriptions of Beatrice are vague and her figure is wrapped
in an atmosphere of "vaporous twilight." Her beauty is not presented to
us by means of word-painting, but rather by its effect on all who behold
her. This is illustrated in the following sonnet, which is justly
considered the most beautiful not only of Dante's poetry but of all
Italian literature:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So gentle and so noble doth appear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My lady when she passes through the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That none her salutation dare repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all eyes turn from her as if in fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She goes her way, and cannot help but hear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The praise of all,&mdash;yet modest still and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Something she seems come down from heaven,&mdash;her seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earth a miracle to show men here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pleasing doth she seem unto the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That to the heart a sweetness seems to move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweetness only known to those who feel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her lips a spirit seems to steal,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A gentle spirit, soft and full of love,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That whispers to the souls of all men,&mdash;"sigh."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The effect of all the conflicting sentiments which agitated Dante's
bosom was to throw him into a serious illness, in the course of which he
had a terrible vision of the approaching death of Beatrice. "Now a few
days after this, it happened that there came upon me a dolorous
infirmity, whence for nine days I suffered most bitter pain; this led me
to such weakness that I was not able to move from my bed. I say, then,
that on the ninth day, feeling my pain almost intolerable, there came to
me a thought concerning my lady. And when I had thought somewhat of her,
and turned again in thought to my own weakened life, and considered how
fragile is its duration, even though it be in health, I began to weep to
myself over so much misery. Whence I said to myself with sighs: verily
the most gentle Beatrice must sometime die. Wherefore there came upon me
so great a depression that I closed my eyes and began to wander in mind,
so that there appeared to me certain faces of ladies with disheveled
hair, who said to me, 'Thou also shalt die.' And after these ladies
certain other faces, horribly distorted, appeared and said: 'Thou art
dead.' Then I seemed to see ladies with disheveled hair going along the
street weeping, and wondrous sad; and the sun grew dark, so that the
stars showed themselves, of such color that methought they wept; and the
birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> as they flew fell dead; and there were mighty earthquakes; and as
I wondered and was smitten with terror in such fancies, methought I saw
a friend come to me and say: 'Dost thou not know? Thy peerless lady has
departed this life.' Then I began to weep very piteously, and not only
in dream, but bathing my cheeks in real tears. And I dreamed that I
looked skyward and saw a multitude of angels flying upwards, and they
had before them a small cloud, exceedingly white.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And the angels
seemed to be singing gloriously, and the words which I seemed to hear
were these: 'Hosanna in the Highest,' and naught else could I hear. Then
it seemed to me that my heart, which was so full of love, said to me:
'It is true, indeed, that our lady lies dead.' And so strong was my
wandering fancy that it showed me this lady dead; and I seemed to see
ladies covering her head with a very white veil, and her face had so
great an aspect of humility that she seemed to say: 'I have gone to
behold the beginning of peace.' And then I seemed to have returned to my
own room, and there I looked toward heaven and began to cry out in
tears: 'O, soul most beautiful, how blessed is he who beholds thee.' And
as I said these words with sobs and tears, and called on death to come
to me, a young and gentle lady who was at my bedside, thinking that my
tears and cries were for grief on account of my infirmity began also to
weep in great fear. Whereupon other ladies who were in the room, noticed
that I wept, and leading away from my bedside her who was joined to me
by close ties of blood,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they came to me to wake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> me from my dream,
and saying: 'Weep no more,' and again: 'Be not so discomforted.' And as
they thus spoke, my strong fancy ceased, and just as I was about to say:
'O, Beatrice, blessed art thou,' and I had already said, 'O, Beatrice&mdash;'
giving a start I opened my eyes and saw that I had been dreaming."</p>

<p>The presentiment of Dante in the above exquisite passage came true.
Beatrice, too fair and good for earth, was called by God to Himself. One
day the poet sat down to write a poem in praise of her and had finished
one stanza when the news came that Beatrice was dead. At first he seemed
too benumbed even for tears, and after a quotation from Jeremiah&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! How is
she become a widow, she that was great among the  nations!"&mdash;</p></div>

<p>at the beginning of the next paragraph, he gives a fantastic discussion
of the symbolical figure nine and its connection with the life and death
of Beatrice. Then the tears began to flow, and unutterable sadness took
possession of his heart. A whole year after he tells us how one day he
sat thinking of her and drawing the picture of an angel, a picture,
alas! which was never finished, as he was interrupted by visitors.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At
another time he tells how one day he saw a number of pilgrims passing
through Florence on their way to Rome, and to them he addressed one of
his most beautiful sonnets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, pilgrims who move on with steps so slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Musing perchance of friends now far away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">So distant is your native land, oh say!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by your actions ye do seem to show?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo! you weep and mourn not when you go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through these our city streets, so sad to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor unto us your meed of pity pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed as we are 'neath heavy weight of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If while I speak you will but wait and hear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely,&mdash;my heart in sighing whispers me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That then you shall go on with sorrow deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Florence has lost its Beatrice dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And words that tell what she was wont to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are potent to make all that hear them weep.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With these lines the New Life practically ends. After one more sonnet,
in which he tells how he was lifted in spirit and had a vision of
Beatrice in paradise, he concludes the book with the following
paragraph, in which we first see a definite purpose on the part of Dante
to write a long poem in praise of Beatrice: "After this sonnet there
appeared to me a wonderful vision, in which I saw things which made me
resolve to say no more of this blessed one until I should be able to
treat more worthily of her, and to come to that I study as much as I
can, as she truly knows. So that if it shall be the pleasure of Him in
whom all things live that my life endure for some years more, I hope to
say of her that which has never yet been said of mortal woman. And then
may it please Him who is Lord of Courtesy, that my soul may go to see
the glory of its lady, that is, the blessed Beatrice who gloriously
looks on the face of him 'qui est per cuncta sæcula benedictus in sæcula
sæculorum. Amen.'" (Who is blessed throughout all the ages.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No poet in Italian literature is better adapted to special study
than Dante, nor is any so profitable. The material is abundant.
The reader should provide himself with Scartazzini's Companion
to Dante, translated by A. J. Butler, or Symond's Introduction
to Dante. These will furnish all necessary facts concerning the
life and works of the poet. It must be remembered that the
Divine Comedy is a difficult poem, and that it takes many
readings and much study to master it. It will be best to begin
by reading Maria F. Rossetti's A Shadow of Dante, which gives a
general outline of the story with copious extracts. Then one of
the numerous translations should be taken up and studied
carefully, canto by canto&mdash;Cary's, Longfellow's, and Norton's
translations (the latter in prose) are the best. An edition of
Cary's translation has been made by the writer of this book
(published by T. Y. Crowell &amp; Co.), with special reference to
the general reader. It contains an introduction, Rossetti's
translation of the New Life, and a revised reprint of Cary's
version of the Divine Comedy furnished with a popular commentary
in the form of foot notes. The number of essays and critical
estimates of Dante in English is legion; perhaps the best three
are those by Carlyle (in Heroes and Hero Worship), Dean Church,
and Lowell. Of especial value is Dinsmore's Aids to the Study of
Dante (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.). </p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>


<p>We have seen, at the end of the last chapter, how Dante had made a vow
to glorify Beatrice, as no other woman had ever been glorified, and how
he studied and labored to prepare himself for the lofty task. The Divine
Comedy is the fulfilment of this "immense promise." Although it is
probable that Dante did not begin to write this poem till after the
death of Henry VII. (1313), yet there can be no doubt that it was slowly
developing in his mind during all the years of his exile.</p>

<p>The Divine Comedy is divided into three parts or books, <i>canticas</i>, as
they are called by Dante: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, each one
containing thirty-three cantos, with one additional introductory canto
prefixed to the Hell. Even the number of lines in the three <i>canticas</i>
is approximately the same.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Dante's love for number-symbols was shown
in the New Life, hence we are justified in accepting the theory that the
threefold division of the poem is symbolical of the Trinity, and that
the thirty-three cantos of each <i>cantica</i> represent the years of the
Savior's life. It is worthy of note that the last word in each of the
three books is "stars." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>The allegory of the Divine Comedy has been the subject of countless
discussions. The consensus of the best modern commentators seems to be,
however, that although the allegory is more or less political, it is
chiefly religious. The great theme is the salvation of the human soul,
represented by Dante himself, who is the protagonist of the poem. As he
wanders first through hell, he sees in all its loathly horrors the
"exceeding sinfulness of sin," and realizes its inevitable punishment;
as he climbs the steep slopes of purgatory, at first with infinite
difficulty, but with ever-increasing ease as he approaches the summit,
he learns by his own experience how hard it is to root out the natural
tendencies to sin that pull the soul downward; and finally, as he mounts
from heaven to heaven, till he arrives in the very presence of God
Himself, he experiences the joy unspeakable that comes to him who,
having purged himself of all sin, is found worthy to join "the
innumerable company of saints and the spirits of just men made perfect."</p>

<p>The Divine Comedy is a visionary journey through the three supernatural
worlds, Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Such visions were by no means
infrequent in the Middle Ages, and Dante had many predecessors. He
simply adopted a poetical device well known to his contemporaries. What
differentiated him from others is the dramatic and intensely personal
character of his vision; the consummate skill with which he interwove
into this one poem all the science, learning, philosophy, and history of
the times; and the lovely poetry in which all these things are embalmed.
To appreciate the vast difference between the Divine Comedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> and
previous works of a similar nature, we need only to read a few pages of
such crude books as the Visions of Alberico, Tugdale, and Saint Brandon.</p>

<p>To Dante and his contemporaries the supernatural world was not what it
is to us to-day, a vast, unbounded space filled with star-systems like
our own: the topography of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise seemed to them
as definite as that of our own planet. The Ptolemaic system of astronomy
(overthrown by Copernicus, yet still forming the framework of Milton's
Paradise Lost) was accepted with implicit confidence. According to this
system the universe consisted of ten heavens or concentric spheres, in
the center of which was our earth, immovable itself, while around it
revolved the heavenly spheres. The earth was surrounded by an atmosphere
of air, then one of fire, and then came in order the heavens of the
moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the fixed stars,
and the Primum Mobile (the source of the motion of the spheres) beyond
which stretched out to infinity the Empyrean, the heaven of light and
love, the seat of God and the angels.</p>

<p>According to Dante, hell is situated in the interior of the earth, being
in shape a sort of funnel with the point downward, and reaching to the
center of the earth, which is also the center of the universe. Purgatory
rises in the form of a truncated cone in the surface of the southern
hemisphere, having in solid form, the same shape as the hollow funnel of
hell. It was formed of the earth which fled before Lucifer, and splashed
up behind him like water, when, after his revolt against the Almighty he
was flung headlong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> from heaven and became fixed in the center of the
earth, as far as possible according to the Ptolemaic system from the
Empyrean and God.</p>

<p>Hell is formed of nine concentric, ever-narrowing terraces, or circles,
exhibiting a great variety of landscapes, rivers, and lakes, gloomy
forests and sandy deserts, all shrouded in utter darkness except where
flickering flames tear the thick pall of night, or the red-hot walls of
Dis gleam balefully over the waters of the Stygian marsh. Here are
punished the various groups of sinners, whom Dante sees, whose suffering
he describes, and with whom he converses as he makes his way downward
from circle to circle.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1300, at Easter time, when Dante began his strange
and eventful pilgrimage, "midway in this our mortal life," he says in
the first line of the poem, that is when he himself was thirty-five
years old. He finds himself lost in a dense forest, not knowing how he
came there, and after wandering for some time, reaches the foot of a
lofty mountain, whose top is lighted by the rays of the morning sun. He
is about to make his way thither, when he is stopped by the appearance,
one after the other, of three terrible beasts, a leopard, a lion, and a
wolf. He falls back in terror to the forest, when suddenly he sees a
figure advancing toward him and learns that this is Vergil, who has been
sent by Beatrice (now in heaven) to lead her lover from the wood of sin
to salvation. To do this it will be necessary for Dante to pass through
the infernal world, then up the craggy heights of purgatory to the
earthly paradise, where Beatrice herself will take charge of him and
lead him from heaven to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> heaven, even to the presence of God Himself.
Dante's courage and confidence fail at this prospect&mdash;he is not Æneas or
St. Paul, he says, to undertake such supernatural journeys&mdash;but when
Vergil tells him that Beatrice herself has sent him, Dante expresses his
willingness to undertake the difficult and awe-inspiring task.</p>

<p>It is nightfall when they reach the gate of hell, over which is written
the dread inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through me you pass into the city of woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through me you pass into eternal pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through me among the people lost for aye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice the founder of my fabric moved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rear me was the task of power divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before me things create were none, save things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal, and eternal I endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hope abandon, ye who enter here."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Entering in they are met with the sound of sighs, moans, and
lamentations, mingled with curses hoarse and deep, and the beating of
hands, all making a hideous din in the starless air, in which a long
train of spirits is whirled about hither and thither stung by wasps and
hornets. These spirits are the souls of those ignoble ones who were
neither for God nor against him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The wretched souls of those, who lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without or praise or blame, with that ill band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of angels mixed, who nor rebellious proved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to impair his luster; nor the depth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hell receives them, lest the accursed tribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should glory thence with exultation vain."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Here Dante recognizes the soul of him who made the "great refusal,"
recalling thus the strange story of the aged hermit, Peter Murrone, who
after fifty-five years and more of solitary life in a cave high up among
the Abruzzi Mountains, was forced to ascend the papal throne, and who
after a short period of ineffectual reign under the name of Celestine
V., resigned, thus making way for Boniface VIII., Dante's bitter enemy.
Vergil's contemptuous remark concerning these souls,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speak not of them, but look and pass them by,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has become proverbial.</p>

<p>Soon after this the two poets reach the shores of the river Acheron,
where Charon, the infernal boatman, is busy ferrying the souls of the
damned to the other side. He refuses to take Dante in his boat, and the
latter falls into a swoon, and being aroused by a clap of thunder, finds
himself on the other side. How he was carried over we are not told. The
wanderers are now in limbo or the first circle of hell, in which are
contained the souls of unbaptized children and of the great and good of
the pagan world, especially the poets and philosophers of ancient Greece
and Rome, who, having lived before the coming of Christ, had through no
fault of their own died without faith in Him who alone can save. These
souls are not punished by physical pain, as is the case with those in
the following circles, but nourishing forever a desire which they have
no hope of ever having satisfied, they pass the endless years of
eternity in gentle melancholy. Here Dante meets the spirits of Homer,
Ovid, Horace, and Lucan, who treat him kindly and make him one of the
band, thus consecrating him as a great poet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"When they together short discourse had held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turned to me, with salutation kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beckoning me; at the which my master smiled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was this all; but greater honor still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Far as the luminous beacon on we passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaking of matters, then befitting well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a magnificent castle we arrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defended by a pleasant stream. O'er this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As o'er dry land we passed. Next, through seven gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with those sages entered, and we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Majestically moved, and in their port<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore eminent authority: they spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"We to one side retired, into a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open and bright and lofty, whence each one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood manifest to view. Incontinent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on the green enamel of the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am exalted in my own esteem."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving this beautiful oasis in the infernal desert, the poets enter the
second circle, where Hell may be said really to begin. Here Dante sees
the monster Minos, the judge of the infernal regions, who assigns to
each soul its proper circle, indicating the number thereof by winding
his tail about his body a corresponding number of times. In circle two
are the souls of the licentious, blown about forever by a violent wind.
Among them Dante recognizes the famous lovers of antiquity, Dido, Helen,
Cleopatra. His attention is especially attracted toward two spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
who, locked closely in each other's arms, are blown hither and thither
like chaff before the wind. Calling upon them to tell him who they are,
he hears the pathetic story of Francesca da Rimini, perhaps the most
famous and beautiful passage in all poetry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"When I had heard my sage instructor name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpowered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lost; and I began: 'Bard! willingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would address those two together coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which seem so light before the wind.' He thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then by that love which carries them along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entreat; and they will come.' Soon as the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed them toward us, I thus framed my speech:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With us, if by none else restrained.' As doves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fond desire invited, on wide wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus issued, from that troop where Dido ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, through the ill air speeding: with such force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cry prevailed, by strong affection urged.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'O gracious creature and benign! who go'st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visiting, through this element obscure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us, who the world with bloody stain imbrued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, for a friend, the King of all, we owned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our prayer to him should for thy peace arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whatso'er to hear or to discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"'Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, that denial takes from none beloved,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That, as thou seest, he yet deserts me not.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The soul, who spilt our life.' Such were their words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At hearing which, downward I bent my looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held them there so long, that the bard cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What art thou pondering?' I in answer thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must they at length to that ill pass have reached!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then turning, I to them my speech addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus began: 'Francesca! your sad fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to tears my grief and pity moves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what and how Love granted, that ye knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your yet uncertain wishes?' She replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No greater grief than to remember days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy, when misery is at hand. That kens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy learn'd instructor yet so eagerly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou art bent to know the primal root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence our love gat being, I will do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who weeps and tells his tale. One day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our delight we read of Launcelot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How him love thralled. Alone we were, and no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicion near us. Oft times by that reading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from our altered cheek. But at one point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wished for smile so rapturously kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me shall separate, at once my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All trembling kissed. The book and writer both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were love's purveyors. In its leaves that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We read no more.' While thus one spirit spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other wailed so sorely, that heart-struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, through compassion fainting, seemed not far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From death, and like a corse fell to the ground."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Passing rapidly over circle three, in which the gluttons lie in mire
under a pelting storm of hail, snow, and rain, torn to pieces by the
three-throated Cerberus; and circle four, where misers and spendthrifts
roll great weights against each other and upbraid each the other with
his besetting sin; we come to circle five, where in the dark and dismal
waters of the Styx the wrathful and the melancholy are plunged. It is
singular that Dante makes low spirits or mental depression as much a sin
as violence and lack of self-control:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The good instructor spake: 'Now seest thou, son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The souls of those, whom anger overcame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, too, for certain know, that underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into these bubbles make the surface heave,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed in the slime, they say: "Sad once were we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in these murky settlings are we sad."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But word distinct can utter none.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they stand at the foot of a dark tower, a light flashes from its top
and another light, far off above the waters, sends back an answer
through the murky air. Dante, full of curiosity, turns to Vergil for
explanation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'There on the filthy waters,' he replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the marsh-gendered fog conceal it not.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Never was arrow from the cord dismissed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ran its way so nimbly through the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a small bark, that through the waves I spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward us coming, under the sole sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Art thou arrived, fell spirit?'&mdash;'Phlegyas, Phlegyas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This time thou criest in vain,' my lord replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slimy pool we pass.' As one who hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some great wrong he hath sustained, whereat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inly he pines: So Phlegyas inly pined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his fierce ire. My guide, descending, stepped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the skiff, and bade me enter next,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close at his side; nor, till my entrance, seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel freighted. Soon as both embarked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More deeply than with others it is wont."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus they cross the Styx, and soon approach the other shore, where
luridly picturesque in the ink-black atmosphere rise the red-hot walls
and towers of the city of Dis:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And thus the good instructor: 'Now, my son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws near the city, that of Dis<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is named,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I thus: 'The minarets already, sir!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, certes, in the valley I descry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had issued.' He replied: 'Eternal fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That inward burns shows them with ruddy flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumed; as in this nether hell thou seest.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"We came within the fosses deep, that moat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This region comfortless. The walls appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they were framed of iron. We had made<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mariner cried vehement: 'Go forth:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The entrance is here.' Upon the gates I spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than a thousand, who of old from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shower'd. With ireful gestures, 'Who is this,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cried, 'that, without death first felt, goes through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The regions of the dead?' My sapient guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sign that he for secret parley wished;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They spake: 'Come thou alone; and let him go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath so hardily entered this realm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone return he by his witless way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If well he know it, let him prove. For thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast been his escort.' Now bethink thee, reader!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What cheer was mine at sound of those curst words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did believe I never should return."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While not only Dante but Vergil himself stand in dismay before the
closed gates of the city, and the threatening devils on the walls, they
hear a roar like that of a mighty wind, and behold! over the waters of
the Styx a celestial messenger comes dry-shod, puts to flight the
recalcitrant devils, and opening the gates with a touch of his wand,
departs without having uttered a word.</p>

<p>Entering the city, Dante sees a vast cemetery covered with tombs, whence
issue flames, and in which are shut up the souls of those who denied the
immortality of the soul. Here occurs the celebrated scene between Dante
and Farinata degli Uberti, who alone, after the battle of Montaperti, in
1260 (when the victorious Ghibellines seriously contemplated razing
Florence to the ground), opposed the motion, and thus saved his native
city from destruction. Here also Dante sees the father of his friend,
Guido Cavalcanti.</p>

<p>In the center of the cemetery yawns a tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> abyss, which leads to
the lower regions of hell. Before they descend this, however, Vergil
explains to Dante the various kinds of sins which are punished in hell.
Those he has seen hitherto (gluttony, licentiousness, avarice, wrath,
and melancholy) all belong to the category of incontinence; those which
are to come are due to malice, and harm not only oneself but others. The
sixth circle, that of the heretics, in which they now are, forms a
transition between the above two general divisions. In circle seven, the
next one below them, are punished the violent, subdivided into three
classes: 1, those who were violent against their fellow-men,&mdash;tyrants,
murderers, and robbers; 2, those who were violent against
themselves,&mdash;suicides and gamblers; 3, those who were violent against
God, nature, and art,&mdash;blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers. In circles
eight and nine are the fraudulent and traitors, the various classes of
which are given later.</p>

<p>After this explanation, the two poets descend the rocky cliff, and find
at the bottom a blood-red river, where, guarded by centaurs, are plunged
the souls of murderers and robbers, in various depths according to the
heinousness of their cruelty and crimes. Crossing this stream they come
to a dark and gloomy wood, composed of trees gnarled and twisted into
all sorts of fantastic shapes, grimly recalling the contortions of a
human body in pain, and covered with poisonous thorns. On the branches
sit hideous harpies, half woman, half bird. Each of these trees contains
the soul of a suicide. Dante, breaking off a small branch, is horrified
to see human blood slowly ooze from the break, and a hissing noise like
escaping steam, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> resolves itself finally into words. From these he
learns that the soul contained in this tree is that of Pier delle Vigne,
prime minister of Frederick II., who tells his sad and pathetic story,
how he became the victim of slander and court intrigue, and how, being
unjustly imprisoned by his master, he committed suicide.</p>

<p>Beyond this gruesome forest the wanderers come out upon a vast sandy
desert, utterly treeless, where they see many wretched souls, some lying
supine, some crouching down in a sitting posture, some walking
incessantly about, all, however, forever trying, but in vain, to ward
off from their naked bodies countless flakes of flame which fall slowly
and steadily like snow</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On Alpine summits, when the wind is hushed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here are punished the blasphemers, violent against God; usurers, violent
against art; and sodomites, violent against nature. Among the latter
Dante recognizes and converses with his old friend, Brunetto Latini, who
prophesies to him his future fame and his exile from Florence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'If thou,' he answer'd, 'follow but thy star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless in fairer days my judgment erred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if my fate so early had not chanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the heavens thus bounteous to thee, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gladly given thee comfort in thy work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that ungrateful and malignant race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in old times came down from Fiesole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will for thy good deeds show thee enmity.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which the poet answers with noble courage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This only would I have thee clearly note:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, so my conscience have no plea against me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do Fortune as she list, I stand prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not new or strange such earnest to my ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speed Fortune then her wheel, as likes her best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clown his mattock; all things have their course."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poets then descend the tremendous cliff leading to circle eight, on
the back of Geryon, a fantastic monster, with face of a good man, but
body of a beast, many-colored and covered over with complicated figures,
being a symbol of the fraud punished in the next circle. This is
subdivided into ten concentric rings, or ditches, with the floor
gradually descending to a well in the center, thus resembling the
circular rows of seats in an amphitheater, converging to the arena. In
these ten <i>malebolge</i>, as Dante calls them&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, evil pits&mdash;are ten
different kinds of fraudulent, panderers, flatterers, those guilty of
simony, false prophets, magicians, thieves, barterers (those who sell
public offices), evil counselors, schismatics, and hypocrites, all
punished with diabolic ingenuity, hewn asunder by the sword, boiled in
lakes of burning pitch, bitten by poisonous snakes, wasted by dire and
hideous disease. As an example of the horrors seen in these evil pits we
give one vivid picture, that of the famous Troubadour Bertrand de Born,
who, having incited the young son of Henry II., of England, to rebel
against his father, is punished in hell by having his head cut off and
carrying it in his hand:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i34">"But I there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lingered to behold the troop, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thing, such as I may fear without more proof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boon companion, who her strong breastplate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids him on and fear not. Without doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A headless trunk, that even as the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sad flock paced onward. By the hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bore the severed member, lantern-wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Woe's me!' The spirit lighted thus himself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two there were in one, and one in two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that may be, he knows who ordereth so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When at the bridge's foot direct he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arm aloft he reared, thrusting the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in our view, that nearer we might hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words, which thus it utter'd: 'Now behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spy the dead: behold, if any else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be terrible as this. And, that on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The counsel mischievous. Father and son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set at mutual war. For Absalom<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of retribution fiercely works in me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the eighth pit are the souls of evil counselors, so completely
swathed in flames that their forms cannot be seen. Dante's attention is
especially attracted to one of these moving flames, with a double-tipped
point, which proves to contain the souls of Diomede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> and Ulysses, who,
as they were together in fraud, are now inseparable in punishment. The
story of his last voyage and final shipwreck, told by Ulysses, how in
his old age, weary of the monotony of home life and longing to know the
secret of the great Western ocean, he set sail with his old companions,
is full of imaginative grandeur:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That labors with the wind, then to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threw out its voice, and spake: when I escaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Circe, who beyond a circling year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had held me near Caieta by her charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thus Æneas yet had named the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my old father, nor return of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should have crowned Penelope with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could overcome in me the zeal I had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To explore the world, and search the ways of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's evil and his virtue. Forth I sailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the deep, illimitable main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With but one bark, and the small faithful band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yet cleaved to me. As Iberia far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as Marocco, either shore I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Sardinian and each isle beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were I and my companions, when we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boundaries not to be o'erstepp'd by man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls of Seville to my right I left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the other hand already Ceuta past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O brothers!' I began, 'who to the West<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Ph&oelig;bus. Call to mind from whence ye sprang:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye were not formed to live the life of brutes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these few words I sharpened for the voyage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind of my associates, that I then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our poop we turned, and for the witless flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each star of the other pole night now beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ours so low, that from the ocean floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rose not. Five times re-illumed, as oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the deep way we entered, when from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all I e'er beheld. Joy seized us straight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon to mourning changed. From the new land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl'd her round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over us the booming billow closed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the center of the amphitheater of Malebolge is a deep and vast well,
guarded by giants, one of whom takes the poets in his arms and deposits
them at the bottom. Here they find the ninth and last circle, where in
four divisions the traitors against relatives, friends, country, and
benefactors, are fixed like flies in amber in a solid lake of ice, swept
by bitter, cold winds. Among the traitors to their country Dante sees
one man who is gnawing in relentless rage at the head of another fixed
in the ice in front of him. Inquiring the cause of this terrible
cruelty, Dante hears the following story, couched in language which
Goethe has declared to be without an equal in all poetry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His jaws uplifting from their fell repast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sinner wiped them on the hairs o' the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he behind had mangled, then began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Thy will obeying, I call up afresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow past cure; which, but to think of, wrings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart, or ere I tell on 't. But if words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruit of eternal infamy to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt see me speak and weep. Who thou mayst be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, nor how here below art come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I do hear thee. Know, I was on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count Ugolino, and the Archbishop he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruggieri. Why I neighbor him so close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now list. That through effect of his ill thoughts<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Within that mew, which for my sake the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already through its opening several moons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the future tore the curtain off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This one, methought, as master of the sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf, and his whelps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the mountain which forbids the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lucca to the Pisan. With lean brachs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inquisitive and keen, before him ranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After short course the father and the sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed tired and lagging, and methought I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bread. Right cruel art thou, if no pang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now had they wakened; and the hour drew near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they were wont to bring us food; the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of each misgave him through his dream, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, at its outlet underneath locked up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horrible tower: whence, uttering not a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look'd upon the visage of my sons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wept not: so all stone I felt within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wept: and one, my little Anselm, cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?" Yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shed no tear, nor answered all that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the next night, until another sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came out upon the world. When a faint beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had to our doleful prison made its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in four countenances I descried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image of my own, on either hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through agony I bit; and they, who thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did it through desire of feeding, rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O' the sudden, and cried, "Father, we should grieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gavest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These weeds of miserable flesh we wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do thou strip them off from us again."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit in stillness. That day and the next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why open'dst not upon us? When we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fourth day, then Gaddo at my feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outstretched did fling him, crying, "Hast no help<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, my father!" There he died; and e'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence I betook me, now grown blind, to grope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over them all, and for three days aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called on them who were dead. Then, fasting got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mastery of grief.' Thus having spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Uncapable of guilt. Onward we passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where others, skarfed in rugged folds of ice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on their feet were turned, but each reversed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Arriving at the very bottom of hell, the poets see the body of Lucifer
fixed in the center thereof (which is at the same time the center of
earth and of the universe), with its upper part projecting into the
freezing air. This monstrous figure, as hideous now as it had been
beautiful before his revolt against God, has three pairs of wings and
three heads, in the mouths of which he tears to pieces the three
arch-traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.</p>

<p>The wanderers climb along the hairy sides of Lucifer and finally reach a
cavity which corresponds to the lowest part of hell, and up into which
are thrust the legs of the monster. They have thus passed the center of
earth and are now in the other or southern hemisphere. Making their way
upward along the course of a stream they finally come out into the open
air, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> the mount of purgatory rises sheer up from the surface of
the great southern sea.</p>

<p>The first cantos of Purgatory are of wonderful beauty, and their
loveliness is heightened by contrast, coming as it does after the
darkness, filth, and horrors of hell. Issuing from the subterranean
passage just before sunrise, the poets see before them a vast expanse of
sea, lighted up by the soft rays of Venus, the morning star, and
gradually becoming brighter as the dawn advances:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up as the first circle, to mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The radiant planet, that to love invites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made all the Orient laugh, and veiled beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the other pole attentive, where I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed joyous. O thou northern site! bereft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed, and widowed, since of these deprived."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they stand watching this scene, a venerable old man (Cato, the
guardian of the island) approaches and tells them to go to the seashore
and wipe off the stains of hell with the reeds that grow there:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Both hands extended on the watery grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My master placed, in graceful act and kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence I of his intent before apprized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched out to him my cheeks suffused with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to my visage he anew restored<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wherever one was plucked another there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling, straightway in its place arose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they linger by the seaside, they suddenly see a bright light far off
over the waters, which, as it approaches nearer, turns out to be a boat
wafted by angelic wings and bearing to purgatory the souls of the saved,
among them a musician, a friend of Dante's who at his request, sings one
of the poet's own songs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Meanwhile we lingered by the water's brink,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No winged course might equal its career.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which when for a space I had withdrawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I looked, and saw it grown in size<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brightness: then on either side appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something, but what I knew not, of bright hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by degrees from underneath it came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another. My preceptor silent yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, while the brightness, that we first discerned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened the form of wings: then when he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pilot, cried aloud, 'Down, down; bend low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shalt thou see true ministers indeed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! how all human means he sets at nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except his wings, between such distant shores.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! how straight up to heaven he holds them reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That not like mortal hairs fall off or change.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"As more and more toward us came, more bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared the bird of God, nor could the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drove ashore in a small bark so swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light, that in its course no wave it drank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavenly steersman at the prow was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visibly written Blessed in his looks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, a hundred spirits and more there sat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'In Exitu Israel de Egypto,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All with one voice together sang, with what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the remainder of that hymn is writ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then soon as with the sign of holy cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He blessed them, they at once leaped out on land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, swiftly as he came, returned. The crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There left, appear'd astounded with the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing around, as one who sees new sights.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"From every side the sun darted his beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his arrowy radiance from mid heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had chased the Capricorn, when that strange tribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting their eyes toward us: 'If ye know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declare what path will lead us to the mount.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Them Vergil answered: 'Ye suppose, perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us well acquainted with this place: but here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, as yourselves, are strangers. Not long erst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We came, before you but a little space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By other road so rough and hard, that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ascent will seem to us as play.' The spirits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from my breathing had perceived I lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew pale with wonder. As the multitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flock round a herald sent with olive branch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear what news he brings, and in their haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tread one another down; e'en so at sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me those happy spirits were fixed, each one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of its errand to depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, cleansed from sin, it might be made all fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then one I saw darting before the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such fond ardor to embrace me, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do the like was moved. O shadows vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except in outward semblance: thrice my hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I clasped behind it, they as oft return'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empty into my breast again. Surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I need must think was painted in my looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that the shadow smiled and backward drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow it I hastened, but with voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sweetness it enjoined me to desist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk with me it would a little pause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It answered: 'Thee as in my mortal frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved, so loosed from it I love thee still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore pause: but why walkest thou here?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Not without purpose once more to return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Journeying this way;' I said: 'but how of thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath so much time been lost?' He answered straight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'No outrage hath been done to me, if he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who when and whom he chooses takes, hath oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denied me passage here; since of just will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will he makes. These three months past indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, whoso chose to enter, with free leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath taken; whence I wandering by the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Tiber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admittance, at that river's mouth, toward which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wings are pointed; for there always throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All such as not to Acheron descend.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then I: '"If new law taketh not from thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory or custom of love-tuned song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whilom all my cares had power to 'swage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please thee therewith a little to console<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit, that encumber'd with its frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traveling so far, of pain is overcome.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Love, that discourses in my thoughts,' he then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began in such soft accents, that within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness thrills me yet. My gentle guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who came with him, so well were pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed nought else might in their thoughts have room.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Fast fixed in mute attention to his notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stood, when lo! that old man venerable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclaiming, 'How is this, ye tardy spirits?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What negligence detains you loitering here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collected, blade or tares, without their pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accustomed, and in still and quiet sort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If aught alarm them, suddenly desert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their meal, assailed by more important care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I that new-come troop beheld, the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserting, hasten to the mountain side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who goes, yet, where he tends, knows not.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor with less hurried step did we depart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus rebuked by Cato for delaying, even thus innocently, their first
duty, which is to purge away their sins, the company of spirits breaks
up and Dante and Vergil make their way to the mountain of purgatory,
which lifts its seven terraces almost perpendicularly from the sea.</p>

<p>Before reaching the first of these terraces, however, they pass over a
steep and rocky slope, ante-purgatory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> as it may be called, where
linger the souls of those who, although saved, neglected their
repentance till late in life, or who died in contumacy with Holy Church.
Among the latter Dante sees Manfred, the unfortunate son of Frederick
II.,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Comely and fair and gentle of aspect,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>who was slain at Benevento, in 1266; and likewise Buonconte da
Montefeltro, who was killed in the battle of Campaldino (1289), and
whose account of the post-mortem fate of his body is singularly
impressive; "There is nothing like it in literature," says Ruskin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i36">"I thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'From Campaldino's field what force or chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Oh!' answered he, 'at Casentino's foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stream there courseth, named Archiano, sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Apennine above the hermit's seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced in the throat, fleeing away on foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bloodying the plain. Here sight and speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail'd me; and, finishing with Mary's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will report the truth; which thou again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell to the living. Me God's angel took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst he of hell exclaimed: "O thou from heaven:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The eternal portion bear'st with thee away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one poor tear that he deprives me of.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of the other, other rule I make."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Thou know'st how in the atmosphere collects<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That vapor dank, returning into water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That evil will, which in his intellect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still follows evil, came; and raised the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smoky mist, by virtue of the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given by his nature. Thence the valley, soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As day was spent, he covered o'er with cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pratomagno to the mountain range;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretched the sky above; so that the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impregnate changed to water. Fell the rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the fosses came all that the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contained not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great river, with such headlong sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed, that nought stayed its course. My stiffened frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid at his mouth, the fell Archiano found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashed it into Arno; from my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loosening the cross, that of myself I made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When overcome with pain. He hurled me on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the banks and bottom of his course;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After leaving Buonconte, Dante and Vergil make their way upward and
finally come across the spirit of Sordello, the famous troubadour, a
native of Mantua and thus a fellow citizen of Vergil. The cordiality
with which they greet each other gives Dante an opportunity to vent his
indignation at the discord existing in Italy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ah, slavish Italy! thou inn of grief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vessel without a pilot in loud storm!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady no longer of fair provinces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from the pleasant sound of his dear land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such glad cheer: while now thy living ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thee abide not without war; and one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malicious gnaws another; aye, of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the same wall and the same moat contains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek, wretched one! around thy seacoasts wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then homeward to thy bosom turn; and mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any part of thee sweet peace enjoy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refitted, if thy saddle be unprest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, people! thou obedient still shouldst live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the saddle let thy Cæsar sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If well thou marked'st that which God commands."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As night is now coming on, during which upward progress cannot be made,
Sordello conducts Dante and Vergil to a pleasant valley:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Betwixt the steep and plain, a crooked path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led us traverse into the ridge's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where more than half the sloping edge expires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed in that fair recess, in color all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been surpassed, as great surpasses less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of the sweetness of a thousand smells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rare and undistinguished fragrance made.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Salve Regina,' on the grass and flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here chanting, I beheld those spirits sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who not beyond the valley could be seen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here Sordello points out the souls of mighty princes who left deep
traces in the history of the times, among them the Emperor Rudolph of
Germany, Peter of Aragon, Philip III. of France, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The king of simple life and plain,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Henry III. of England. The scene that follows is one of the most
celebrated, as well as beautiful in the Divine Comedy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now was the hour that wakens fond desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seems to mourn for the expiring day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I, no longer taking heed to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One risen from its seat, which with its hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Audience implored. Both palms it joined and raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixing its steadfast gaze toward the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As telling God, 'I care for nought beside.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Te Lucis Ante,' so devoutly then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all my sense in ravishment was lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rest after, softly and devout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directed to the bright supernal wheels.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I saw that gentle band silently next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look up, as if in expectation held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale and in lowly guise; and, from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, forth issuing descend beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two angels, with two flame-illumined swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken and mutilated of their points.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green as the tender leaves but newly born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vesture was, the which, by wings as green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beaten, they drew behind them, fanned in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little over us one took his stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other lighted on the opposing hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that the troop were in the midst contained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in their visages the dazzled eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lost, as faculty that by too much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is overpowered. 'From Mary's bosom both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are come,' exclaimed Sordello, 'as a guard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the vale, 'gainst him, who hither tends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent.' Whence not knowing by which path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came, I turned me round; and closely pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All frozen, to my leader's trusted side."<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"My insatiate eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile to heaven had traveled, even there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearest the axle: When my guide inquired:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I answered: 'The three torches, with which here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pole is all on fire.' He then to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are there beneath; and these, risen in their stead.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"While yet he spoke, Sordello to himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew him, and cried: 'Lo there our enemy!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his hand pointed that way to look.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Along the side, where barrier none arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the little vale, a serpent lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a beast that smooths its polished coat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Licking his back. I saw not, nor can tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How those celestial falcons from their seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved, but in motion each one well descried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent fled; and, to their stations, back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angels up return'd with equal flight."<br /></span>

<p>After conversing with several friends whom he meets here, Dante falls
asleep and is carried thus unconscious by Lucia (symbol of divine grace)
to the gate of purgatory proper. When he awakes the sun is two hours
high. Three steps lead to the gate, one dark and broken, symbol of a
"broken and a contrite heart"; one of smooth, white marble, symbol of
confession; and one purple, repentance. On the threshold of diamond (the
immovable foundation of Holy Church) sits an angel with a sword and two
keys; with the former he cuts seven P's on Dante's forehead (the Latin
word for sin, <i>peccatum</i>), and with the latter he opens the gate, which
as it swings open sends forth a sound of heavenly music:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Attentively I turned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And 'We praise thee, O God,' methought I heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In accents blended with sweet melody.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of choral voices, that in solemn chant<br /></span>

<p>In Terrace I. are punished the proud, crushed beneath enormous weights.
On the side of the mountain wall are sculptured wonderful bas-reliefs,
representing examples of humility; especially famous is the one which
tells the story of Trajan's justice, a story which led Pope Gregory to
make a prayer to God, who granted it, for the release of the pagan
emperor's soul from hell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"There, was storied on the rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The exalted glory of the Roman prince,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His mighty conquest, Trajan the Emperor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A widow at his bridle stood, attired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tears and mourning. Round about them trooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full throng of knights; and overhead in gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch appeared amid all these to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Grant vengeance, Sire! for, woe beshrew this heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son is murdered.' He replying seemed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Wait now till I return.' And she, as one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made hasty by her grief: 'O Sire! if thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost not return?'&mdash;'Where I am, who then is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May right thee.'&mdash;'What to thee is other's good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou neglect thy own?'&mdash;'Now comfort thee;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he answers. 'It beseemeth well<br /></span>

<p>Farther on in the same terrace they see similar sculptures representing
examples of punished pride, such as the fall of Lucifer, and the
destruction of Niobe. In each of the following terraces these examples
of sin and the opposite virtue are given, represented, however, by
various means.</p>

<p>Among the proud, Dante sees the miniature painter, Oderisi of Adubbio,
who pronounces those words on the vanity of earthly fame, which have
been proverbial:</p>

<p>Passing through Terrace II., where the envious sit sadly against the
rocky wall, with their eye-lids sewn together, and Terrace III., where
the wrathful are shrouded in a black, stifling mist, the poets reach
Terrace IV., where the slothful are punished. Here Vergil explains the
apparent paradox that love is the root of all evil as well as good.
Love, he says, is the desire for something; desire for those things
which harm others&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, love for evil, produces pride, envy, and
wrath. These are punished in the first three terraces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> Insufficient
desire or love for that which is good&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, God&mdash;is punished in
Terrace IV., that of the "slothful in well-doing"; excessive desire for
merely earthly things, which are not evil in themselves, but only in
their excess, produces avarice, gluttony, and licentiousness; these are
punished in the last three terraces.</p>

<p>Ascending now to Terrace V., Dante sees the souls of Pope Adrian, and
Hugh Capet, founder of the long dynasty of the kings of France, who
gives a brief but admirable summary of the development of the monarchy
in France. As they are walking along this terrace, suddenly a mighty
earthquake shakes the whole mountain, and while Dante is still filled
with amazement and dread at this strange phenomenon, they are overtaken
by the spirit of Statius, who explains the cause of the earthquake,
telling how, when a soul has been completely purged of its sins, and the
time of its redemption has arrived, it rises spontaneously from its
place, and joyfully makes its way toward the heavens above, while the
whole mountain rejoices with him, and the souls along the slope above
and below cry out: "Glory to God in the highest!"</p>

<p>Statius now accompanies Dante and Vergil and all three mount to Terrace
VI., where the gluttons are punished, being worn to skin and bone by
hunger and thirst, which are only increased by the sight of waterfalls
and trees laden with fruit. The last terrace is swathed in flames of
fire, within which move about the licentious. Here Dante sees many
famous poets and greets with especial joy Guido Guinicelli of Bologna,
who he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">My betters, who have ever used the sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasant rhymes of love."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Through this wall of living flame, Dante, too, must pass before he can
reach the summit of purgatory. His spirit, indeed, is willing, but his
flesh is weak; he hesitates long before daring to enter the fiery
furnace. Vergil urges him on in the tenderest manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The escorting spirits turned with gentle looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward me; and the Mantuan spake: 'My son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember thee, remember thee, if I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee; now I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this be sure; though in its womb that flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand years contained thee, from thy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach; and with thy hands thy vesture's hem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay now all fear, oh! lay all fear aside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn hither, and come onward undismayed.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I still, though conscience urged, no step advanced.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"When still he saw me fixed and obstinate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat disturb'd he cried: 'Mark now, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Beatrice thou art by this wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divided.' As at Thisbe's name the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pyramus was open'd (when life ebbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name that springs forever in my breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"He shook his forehead; and, 'How long,' he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Linger we now?' then smiled, as one would smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the fire before me then he walked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Statius, who erewhile no little space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had parted us, he prayed to come behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I would have cast me into molten glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cool me, when I entered; so intense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raged the conflagrant mass. The sire beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort me, as he proceeded, still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Beatrice talked. 'Her eyes,' saith he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'E'en now I seem to view.' From the other side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice, that sang did guide us; and the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where the path led upward. 'Come,' we heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come, blessed of my father.' Such the sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hailed us from within a light; which shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So radiant, I could not endure the view."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Above this last terrace stretches out the lovely earthly paradise, but
before the poets can reach it night comes on, and Dante sleeps on the
steps, guarded by Vergil and Statius, as a flock is watched over by its
shepherd. The passage which describes this scene, and Dante's vision, is
a beautiful one:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Each of us had made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stair his pallet; not that will, but power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had failed us, by the nature of that mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbidden further travel. As the goats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That late have skipt and wanton'd rapidly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their supper on the herb, now silent lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While noon-day rages; and the goatherd leans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the swain, that lodges out all night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperse them: even so all three abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I as a goat, and as the shepherds they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close pent on either side by shelving rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A little glimpse of sky was seen above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet by that little I beheld the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In magnitude and lustre shining forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more than wonted glory. As I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tidings of future hap. About the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I believe, when Venus from the east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems alway glowing with the fire of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady young and beautiful, I dreamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought I saw her ever and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I am Leah:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> for my brow to weave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please me at the crystal mirror, here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her glass abides the livelong day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her radiant eyes beholding, charmed no less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than I with this delightful task. Her joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In contemplation, as in labor mine.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"And now as glimmering dawn appeared, that breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My slumber; whence I rose, and saw my guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already risen. 'That delicious fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which through so many a branch the zealous care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appease thy hunger.' Such the words I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Vergil's lip; and never greeting heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pleasant as the sounds. Within me straight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desire so grew upon desire to mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increasing for my flight. When we had run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, and thus he spake: 'Both fires, my son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art arrived, where of itself my ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No further reaches. I, with skill and art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For guide. Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ercome the straiter. Lo! the sun, that darts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beam upon thy forehead: lo! the herb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arborets and flowers, which of itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This land pours forth profuse. Till those bright eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To succor thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wander where thou wilt.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Dante, having been led by reason (represented by Vergil) to purge
himself of sin and vice, is now to put himself under the guidance of
heavenly wisdom (represented by Beatrice), by whom he is to visit the
homes of the blessed. First, however, he lingers in the earthly paradise
which forms the summit of purgatory, and sees strange sights before
Beatrice reveals herself to him.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the landscape in the earthly paradise are of
surpassing beauty and choice of quotation is exceedingly difficult. Only
a few passages can be given here:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lively greenness the new-springing day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the champain leisurely my way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious odor breathed. A pleasant air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That intermitted never, never veered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of softest influence: at which the sprays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where first the holy mountain casts his shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their top the feathered quiristers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applied their wonted art, and with full joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcomed those hours of prime, and warbled shrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept tenor; even as from branch to branch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the piny forests on the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Chiassi,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> rolls the gathering melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Eolus hath from his cavern loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dripping south. Already had my steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though slow, so far into that ancient wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transported me, I could not ken the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I had entered; when, behold! my path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was bounded by a rill, which, to the left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little rippling waters bent the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That issued from its brink. On earth no wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mixture in itself, compared with this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transpicuous clear; yet darkly on it rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admits or sun or moon-light there to shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"My feet advanced not; but my wondering eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender may-bloom, flush'd through many a hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In prodigal variety: and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As object, rising suddenly to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from our bosom every thought beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the rare marvel chases, I beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady all alone, who, singing, went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all o'er painted. 'Lady beautiful!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, who (if looks, that used to speak the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are worthy of our trust) with love's own beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost warm thee,' thus to her my speech I framed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proserpine, in that season, when her child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"As when a lady, turning in the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One step before the other to the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the yellow and vermilion flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus turned she at my suit, most maiden-like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veiling her sober eyes; and came so near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving where the limpid waters now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laved the green swerd, her eyes she deigned to raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shot such splendor on me, as I ween<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the opposite bank she stood and smiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through her graceful fingers shifted still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The intermingling dyes, which without seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lofty land unbosoms. By the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A curb forever to the pride of man),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was by Leander not more hateful held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For floating, with inhospitable wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flood, because it gave no passage thence.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Strangers ye come; and haply in this place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cradled human nature in her birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering, ye not without suspicion view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,<br /></span>

<p>The poet now beholds a mystical procession of strange and wonderful
beasts, venerable old men, beautiful maidens dressed in red, white,

<p>After Beatrice has rebuked Dante for his wayward conduct in life, and he
repents in bitter tears, he is led by Matilda to the streams of Lethe
and Eunoe, and bathing therein, is made "pure and apt for mounting to
the stars."</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the paradise of Dante is composed of nine
spheres enclosed by the Empyrean, which itself is boundless, and is the
seat of the Godhead, surrounded by the celestial hierarchy of seraphim,
cherubim, thrones, dominions, virtues, powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> principalities,
archangels, and angels. The blessed are here arranged on seats in the
form of a rose, surrounding a lake of liquid light, in which they,
gazing, see all the fulness of the glory of God. These souls, however,
by a mystical virtue of ubiquity, are likewise seen by Dante in the
various heavens through which he, with Beatrice, passes, and manifest
themselves to him in various forms of light, flames, flashes, sparkles,
or shapes made of fiery particles. The souls of the blessed, which are
thus distributed over the nine heavens, have varying degrees of
felicity. Thus, in the first heaven&mdash;that of the moon&mdash;Piccarda, sister
of Corso Donati, appears to Dante, faint and dim in that tenuous
atmosphere, as a "pearl set on a white forehead," and tells him how,
having been forced by her brother to break her vows as a nun, and not
having shown tenacity of purpose in opposing his tyranny, she now
occupies the lowest sphere of Paradise. Yet this she does with perfect
content and happiness, since such is the will of God, for, she says, to
quote that one incomparable line, as Matthew Arnold calls it:</p>

<p>Rising from heaven to heaven with Beatrice, Dante passes through Mercury
and Venus, in the former of which are the souls of Christians who sought
with over-much zeal for earthly glory, and in the latter those who were
inclined too much to mere human love, and finally reaches the sun, where
he sees the great doctors of theology. Here Saint Thomas Aquinas, a
Dominican himself, tells in beautiful language the story of St. Francis
of Assisi and the establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> his order; while the Franciscan, St.
Bonaventura, with the same exquisite courtesy, tells the story of St.
Dominic.</p>

<p>In Mars, Dante sees the souls of Christian martyrs and warriors, many of
whom form themselves before the eyes of the poet into a wonderful cross
of roseate light, flashing in countless splendors. Here, as we have
already seen, he meets and converses with his ancestor, Cacciaguida. In
Saturn the poet beholds a wonderful ladder of light, with spirits
mounting and descending upon it, a ladder such as</p>

<p>Here Peter Damian tells of the mystery of predestination, and St.
Benedict describes the founding of his order at Montecassino.</p>

<p>After the passing away of this glorious vision Dante is examined as to
his faith by St. Peter, his hope by St. James, and his love by St. John;
then being found worthy of being admitted into the presence of God, he
rises to the Empyrean, beholds the Blessed Rose, where are seated the
saints of all ages, and finally catches an instantaneous glimpse of the
glory and mystery of the Trinity. In this supreme vision his desires
find full fruition, and his spirit, overcome by the overwhelming glory
of the Godhead, fails him, and thus his vision comes to an end,</p>

<p>Such is the Divine Comedy of Dante, which has won the undying admiration
of all great minds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> the poet's own time down to the present. It
would lead us too far to go into a detailed analysis of its greatness
here, but with one consent men like Carlyle, Ruskin, Gladstone,
Browning, and Tennyson in England; Tholuck, Witte, and Kraus, in
Germany; Longfellow and Lowell in America, attribute the title of
supreme genius to this poem.</p>

<p>The Divine Comedy is universal in its compass, containing the elements
of dramatic, epic, and lyric poetry; full of sublime imaginations,
touching and pathetic episodes, and not deficient even in humor,
grotesque at times, but often of a strangely sweet and tender nature.
The language is astonishingly simple and concise, and invariably
represents the thought of the poet with absolute truth and fidelity. We
find in this wonderfully condensed poem no mere epithets, no mere
arabesques of style such as adorn the lesser thoughts of lesser men.
Each word is in its right place. "It is amazing," says Ruskin, "how
every word, almost every syllable, reveals new meanings the more we
study them." The metaphors of Dante are especially famous, for the most
part simple and drawn from everyday life, yet unexcelled in beauty and
especially in their perfect and complete adaptation to the point they
are meant to illustrate. Such are those of the old tailor threading his
needle, the sheep leaving the fold in huddling groups, the fish
disappearing from view in the depths of clear water, and the pearl
faintly discernible on a white forehead.</p>

<p>Above all, the personality of the author lends a dramatic interest to
the poem and exercises a fascination on the reader. As Lowell says, "The
man behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> the verse is far greater than the verse itself."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In the
midst of the wonderful landscapes of his own creation, dark and
terrible, soft and beautiful, he walks among the men and <ins title="May be 'women'">woman</ins> of all
ages; he talks to them and hears their stories of half-forgotten crimes
and tragedies; he brands them with infamy or sets upon their brows the
wreath of praise. It is his love for Beatrice&mdash;now become the symbol of
spiritual life&mdash;which leads him through the realms of sin over the steep
rocks of Purgatory to the glory ineffable of God.</p>

<p>Completely a man of his age, Dante incorporates into the Divine Comedy
all its science and learning, its theology, philosophy, astronomy, use
of classical authors, way of looking at the insignificance of the
present life in comparison with the life to come. All these things have
still a distinct medieval stamp. Yet Dante is at the same time the most
original of poets. It is his mighty individuality which, rising above
the conventionality of his age and country, has made him a world-poet,
as true to-day as ever in his depiction of the human heart in all its
sin and sorrow, virtue, and vice, in its love and hate and its
inextinguishable aspiration toward a better and happier existence in the
world beyond the grave.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">PETRARCH</p>


<p>It is hard for people to-day to realize the enormous difference between
the medieval and modern world. The former was full of superstition and
naïve belief; authority reigned supreme; in religion no one dreamed of
questioning the decrees of church and pope; in philosophy a question was
settled by a quotation from Aristotle or his scholastic representative,
St. Thomas Aquinas. This same blind following of authority was
exemplified in art&mdash;painters imitated slavishly their predecessors, and
up to the appearance of Cimabue and Giotto no one dreamed of improving
on the stiff conventionalities of the Byzantine artists. In scholarship,
criticism&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, individual judgment&mdash;was unknown; in science, all
such old-world fables as the mandragora, dragons, phenix, and unicorn
were devoutly received as true zoölogy, while the Ptolemaic system of
astronomy was unquestioned. The idea of progress was utterly unknown;
the world had been created exactly as it was, and would remain so till
the coming of Christ, when a new heaven and a new earth would be formed.
So, in the political and social world, the thought that the existing
state of things could change would have seemed absurd. It needs no words
of mine to demonstrate the vast difference between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> conceptions
and the present world, with its idea of illimitable progress, its
criticism of all things high and low, its denial that authority in
church and state is just, simply because it is old; its eager
acceptation of all innovations; its cultivation of the individual in all
departments of life; to say nothing of the vast field opened up by the
discoveries of positive science.</p>

<p>Dante stands at the end of the old order of things, rising like a mighty
mountain peak over the dead plain of medieval mediocrity.</p>

<p>Yet he is not an innovator; he does not inaugurate a new period of
civilization. When he died he left no school of followers to carry on
his work; he closed an epoch rather than opened one. It is true that for
a hundred years or more men did imitate his Divine Comedy, but only in
the outward form thereof, neglecting the poetical and æsthetical side,
for which indeed Dante's contemporaries had little or no appreciation.
It is only in the nineteenth century that Dante has become a power in
Italy as voicing the universal desire for a united fatherland.</p>

<p>The man who begins the mighty movement of the Renaissance, from which
modern civilization takes its rise, is Francesco Petrarch. It is strange
to think that he, so utterly different in mental attitude from Dante,
was seventeen years old when the latter died. Yet the change which he
represents was being slowly prepared by his predecessors. As we have
seen, the study of the Latin language and authors had never fully died
out in the Middle Ages; especially in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries the classic writers&mdash;Vergil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> Ovid, Statius, Livy&mdash;were read
more and more, not, however, as examples of literary excellence, or as
revealing the culture of antiquity, but as mines of practical wisdom, or
as supplying quotations and examples for philosophical and theological
discussions. The classic writers were made to fit in with medieval ways
of thinking, and thus subordinated to the then existing state of
civilization. With Petrarch, however, comes a complete change in all
these respects. For him the classic writers were the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
elegant form; he strove to penetrate into their spirit, to appreciate
fully the peculiar excellence of each one; and above all to clear
antiquity from its barnacle-like covering of medieval traditions and
superstitions and to present Roman civilization, its learning, science,
and art, as it was. To him the Middle Ages were a period of degradation,
which had long hidden from view the past glories of Rome; and he now,
for the first time in history, broke away from the present and immediate
past, and turned his eyes back to ancient times. In so doing he founded
the Renaissance in Italy, and laid down the lines along which all
subsequent students of classical antiquity were to follow. In all these
respects Petrarch is justly considered, not only the founder of modern
classical scholarship, but the founder of modern civilization as well.
He has been referred to by more than one historian as the Columbus of a
new intellectual world.</p>

<p>The life of Petrarch is intensely interesting, and, contrary to the case
of Dante, the difficulty in giving an outline of it consists not in the
absence of well-ascertained facts, but in an embarrassment of riches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
For we know more of the details of Petrarch's life than we do of any
other ancient writer.</p>

<p>Francesco Petrarch was born in 1304 at Arezzo, whither his father, a
prominent lawyer of Florence, had gone on being exiled in 1302, at the
same time as Dante. After moving about some time in Italy, the family
finally settled at Avignon, in southern France, then famous as the seat
of the Roman papacy during the so-called Babylonian captivity. From 1315
to 1319 Francesco was sent to school at the neighboring town of
Charpentras; in 1319 he went to the University of Montpellier to study
law, and in 1323 went to the University of Bologna. At the university,
however, he neglected law for the classic writers, and he tells us how
one day his father appeared and burnt all his Latin books, with the
exception of Vergil and Cicero's Rhetoric, which by means of tears and
entreaties he succeeded in saving from the flames.</p>

<p>After the death of his parents, in 1326, Petrarch settled down in
Avignon and devoted himself to his favorite studies. As he was without
means he entered the clergy and henceforth was relieved of all anxiety
in regard to money. From this time on his life was spent in study, in
the collection of a library, in writing books, in travel, and visits to
his friends. Petrarch was very fond of traveling and his letters abound
with interesting descriptions of the places he had seen. Yet, in spite
of this passion for travel, he loved also the quiet and tranquil
existence of country life. Here he could indulge to his heart's content
his love for nature, the beauty of which he was practically the first to
describe in sympathetic language. It was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> satisfy this love for
nature and the "quiet life," that Petrarch bought a small property in
Vaucluse, near Avignon, and here he never failed to return from time to
time during all his later life, when tired of travel, weighed down by
care, or depressed by the loss of friends and the "creeping steps of
age."</p>

<p>Petrarch seemed to have had a peculiar faculty for making friends; he
was loved and admired by high and low. Among these countless friends are
worthy of especial mention the powerful Colonna family, father and two
sons, who played so important a part in the history of Italy; King
Robert of Naples; the Emperor Charles IV., who wished to have Petrarch
accompany him to Germany; King John of France, who wished to retain him
in Paris; Pope Urban IV., who offered him the position of papal
secretary. There were scores of others of humbler rank, among them
Boccaccio, his faithful admirer and lifelong friend. Not only kings and
princes lavished honors on Petrarch, but cities as well: Florence
offered to restore his father's property and make him professor at the
university if he would live there; Venice gave him a palace in return
for his library; and in 1340 the cities of Paris and Rome, at the same
time, invited him to receive the laurel crown of poet.</p>

<p>After due deliberation Petrarch accepted the invitation of Rome, and on
Easter Sunday, 1340, in the presence of an immense company of people, he
was crowned at the capitol, amid the blare of trumpets and the
acclamations of the assembled multitudes. This scene may be considered
as the climax of Petrarch's victorious career.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>No man outwardly ever had a happier life than he. He was well-to-do; was
handsome and amiable; surrounded by friends; admired and flattered by
all Europe; looked on as a great poet and a prodigy of learning. Surely,
if any man could be content, Petrarch was that man. And yet he was not
happy&mdash;owing to his peculiar character, his sensitiveness, his streak of
melancholy, his immense vanity which could never be fully satisfied, and
especially owing to the constant struggle that went on in his soul
between the medieval ascetic view of life (which he could never wholly
shake off) and the more worldly modern view, which he himself
inaugurated. Owing to all these things, I say, there is a tinge of
sadness in all his writings. Perhaps no man ever lived who illustrated
so well the beautiful words of the old Latin poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"E'en where the founts of pleasure flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bitter something bubbles up."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, Petrarch's character presents us with strange contrasts. He who
loved travel so much is constantly writing about the joys of country
life; constantly seen in the gay and often licentious courts of princes,
he wrote a treatise in praise of the solitary life; receiving his living
from the church and naturally religious, many of his acts were contrary
to both religion and morality.</p>

<p>And yet Petrarch was not a hypocrite. No one can doubt his sincerity;
these things are only the outward expression of that struggle which was
constantly going on in his heart. Like St. Paul, he seemed always to be
crying out, "The good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would
not, that I do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter part of his life was thus spent in ever-increasing sadness.
In 1347 his friend, Colonna, died; in 1348, Laura; in 1347 his high
hopes concerning the restoration of the ancient glory of the Roman
Republic by Rienzi, the "last of the tribunes," were suddenly dashed by
the fall and death of the latter. Henceforth Petrarch spent his life
wandering from city to city, from court to court, surrounded by an
aureole of glory, yet never at rest, except when he retired to the quiet
seclusion of Vaucluse.</p>

<p>In 1370 he went to the university town of Padua, then the center of an
active intellectual life. In the spring of the same year he started for
Rome, in response to an invitation of the pope, but fell so grievously
ill at Ferrara that he gave up his journey and settled down at Arquà, a
village not far from Padua, where he died July 18, 1374. He was found
dead in his library, bending over a folio volume.</p>

<p>As may be supposed from Petrarch's enthusiasm for the Latin authors,
most of his own works were written in that language. It is a generous
trait of literary and scholarly, as well as of religious, enthusiasts
that they are not content to receive the treasures of art and learning,
but feel impelled to impart their own joys to others. Petrarch was not
only an eager student, but devoted his life to making known to others
the riches and glory of ancient Rome. All this he does in his numerous
Latin works. These include, in poetry, bucolics and eclogues, imitated
from Vergil; poetic epistles, imitated from Horace; and especially his
"Africa," from which he expected immortality, an epic poem on the life
of Scipio Africanus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> Of especial importance in the development of the
Renaissance and the Revival of Learning are his prose Latin works. Chief
among these we may mention his history of Illustrious Men; his moral and
religious tractates&mdash;The Remedy of Fortune, the Solitary Life; and
especially his letters, six hundred in number, written in a Latin style
which infinitely surpassed anything produced till then, and which
founded a branch of literature which was most popular throughout all the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>For our purpose here, however, we can only discuss in detail Petrarch's
Italian poetry&mdash;he wrote no Italian prose. It is this which gives him
his place in literature as the first great lyric poet of modern times.</p>

<p>We have seen that Italian lyrical poetry began in Sicily, and that,
carried thence to Bologna and Tuscany, it formed a new school, which
found its highest expression in Dante. Petrarch once more founds a new
school of lyrics, which, while still in some respects recalling the
writings of his predecessors, is yet in spirit far different from them.
With him poetry is no longer a matter of chivalrous ideals, as with the
troubadours, or of symbolism and philosophy, as with Guido Guinicelli
and Dante, but the expression of his own genuine feelings. His Laura is
not like the Beatrice of the Divine Comedy, a mere abstraction, a
personification of virtue and symbol of religion, but is a woman of
flesh and blood, beautiful and virtuous, but not ethereal and
mystical&mdash;a woman, in fact,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Not too bright or good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For human nature's daily food."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></div></div>

<p>In his songs, then, Petrarch describes real things&mdash;the beauty of Laura
in all its details; her coldness and his suffering; and especially the
conflicting feelings which tormented his soul. In his subjectivity, his
psychological analysis of feelings, his use of poetry to express his own
mental experiences; in his lovely descriptions of nature; and especially
in his melancholy, the far-off anticipation of the "Weltschmerz,"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Petrarch is indeed the first modern lyrical poet.</p>

<p>He himself confidently expected immortality from his Latin works, which,
alas! for the vanity of human expectations, are now forgotten by all
except special students. He apparently looked with contempt on his
Italian lyrics, yet this was only affectation, for even in his later
years he carefully revised them. These songs and sonnets are still
unsurpassed in Italian literature. Many, it is true, are artificial, and
on account of puns, antitheses, and conceits are repugnant to modern
taste; yet the large number of his best poems are exquisite pictures of
womanly beauty, with a charming landscape as a background, all enveloped
in an atmosphere of lovely poetry, full of tenderness, pathos, and
genuine feeling. Above all, they are written in a style and with a
harmony of numbers unknown till then and not surpassed since.</p>

<p>Petrarch's Italian poetry consists of some 375 sonnets, ballads, and
songs (of which the vast majority are sonnets), and in the twelve
chapters, or books, of the so-called Triumphs. These are, with but few
exceptions, consecrated to the story of his love for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> certain woman
named Laura, concerning whose actual existence as much contest has been
waged as over that of Beatrice. It seems now pretty definitely
ascertained that Laura was no mere fancy-picture, but a real being. She
was the daughter of Audibert de Noves, and the wife of Ugo de Sade, to
whom she bore eleven children. She died April 6, 1348, probably of the
pest, which then was raging. Petrarch saw her for the first time April
6, 1327, and for twenty-one years worshiped her from a respectful
distance. There is little story or event in all these sonnets.
Petrarch's love is not returned by Laura, he makes no progress in her
affections, and his poems are devoted for the most part to descriptions
of her beauty, coldness, and indifference, and his own state of
wretchedness.</p>

<p>Among the many sonnets descriptive of Laura's beauty we may take the
following, in which she is declared to be the most perfect example of
Nature's handiwork:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The stars, the elements, and Heaven have made<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That all expression far beneath it gleams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No base desire lives in that heavenly light,<br /></span>

<p>In another sonnet he tells how he was affected the first time he saw
her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Sun never rose so beautiful and bright<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The day I first took up this am'rous load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That face whose fellow ne'er on earth abode&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>Petrarch not only gives general descriptions of the beauty of his lady
and of its effect, as his predecessors had done, but he gives over and
over again details thereof, especially her eyes and hair:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Say, from what vein did Love procure the gold<br /></span>

<p>He is especially fond of describing the scenes where she is, thus
combining with her own charms those of lovely nature. Thus he sees her
on the banks of clear streams, sitting on the green grass, with blossoms
falling upon her from the trees in springtime, as in the following lines
from one of his most beautiful songs:</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of all her beauty, he is not happy; the thought of her
never leaves him. When absent from her he is most miserable:</p>

<p>Above all, his torment is increased by the contest between his religious
feelings and his love, which, earthly as it was, seemed to be
inconsistent with his duty as a Christian. Yet he cannot tear his heart
away from the object of his affection. Hence arises a constant warring
of the flesh against the spirit, and a vacillation which finds
expression in sentiments diametrically opposite. Thus at times he
declares that his love for Laura is a blessing to him, leading him to a
virtuous and religious life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Lady, in your bright eyes<br /></span>

<p>Then comes another mood, in which his love seems sinful and he prays God
to lead him to a better life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This state of his mind, divided against itself, finds its best
expression in the song which is regarded as one of the most beautiful of
his poems. In the various strophes conflicting sentiments arise,
develop, and reach a climax, only to be overthrown by a sudden revulsion
of feeling; fame, happiness, the sweetness of love beckon the poet on;
then comes the chilling thought of death to show that all things earthly
are nothing but vanity. Unfortunately this song is too long to be quoted
here entire. We give the first strophe and the refrain:</p>

<p>His love thus purified and his thoughts now turned to God alone, the
poet awaits in resignation the coming of the inevitable hour of death.
The "Book of Songs and Sonnets," as his Italian poetry may be called,
ends in a beautiful hymn to the Virgin Mary, in which the poet breathes
forth all his chastened sorrow and hopes. From this we select the

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">BOCCACCIO</p>


<p>We have hitherto discussed the development of poetry almost exclusively;
and this is justifiable, for in Italy, as in all other countries, the
development of prose as a form of literature comes after that of poetry.
Petrarch wrote no prose in Italian; and although Dante wrote his Banquet
and, in part, his New Life in prose, yet the former is couched in
scholastic phraseology and the prose portion of the latter is of small
compass. Giovanni Boccaccio, although not so great a poet as Dante, or
so great a scholar and master of form as Petrarch, is yet of high
importance in the history of Italian literature from a double point of
view, as the first great writer of prose and the founder of the modern
novel.</p>

<p>We can only give here a brief outline of his life and character, before
passing on to his works. He was born in Paris in 1313, the son of a
Florentine merchant and a young French gentlewoman. Going to Florence
with his father, he was sent to school and is said to have written
verses before the age of seven. His father, a merchant himself, wished
his son to follow the same career, and at the age of fourteen the boy
was taken to Naples with this purpose in view. In this "great, sinful
city" Boccaccio passed his youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> at first in business, then in the
study of law, both of which, however, he heartily disliked. Making the
acquaintance of some well-known scholars, he was inducted into a love
for study, and resolved to devote himself to a literary career.</p>

<p>About 1340 he left Naples and returned to Florence, which henceforth
became his residence, although he was frequently absent from it on
matters of business and pleasure. For he soon became known as a scholar
and poet, and, in accordance with the customs of the times, he was
honored by his city by being sent on frequent embassies. In this
capacity he went, in 1350, to Ravenna, to the daughter of Dante; in
1354, to Pope Innocent VI., at Avignon; and in 1351, to Petrarch at
Padua, in order to induce the great poet and scholar to reside in
Florence. This meeting with the great apostle of the New Learning was an
important event in Boccaccio's life, who from henceforth became an
enthusiastic admirer of Petrarch. He plunged still more eagerly into the
study of classic antiquity; and although not so great a scholar as
Petrarch, he accomplished some things which the latter had not been able
to do. Thus he learned Greek, imperfectly, however, and introduced to
the western world a knowledge of that language (unknown to the Middle
Ages) by bringing Leontius Pilatus to Florence as a professor in the
university. It was at the dictation of the latter that Boccaccio wrote
down his Latin translation of the Homeric poems, which, worthless as it
now seems, then excited widespread admiration.</p>

<p>Boccaccio differed from Petrarch in being an ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> admirer and
indefatigable student of Dante. Petrarch had once declared that he had
never read the Divine Comedy. The influence of Dante on Boccaccio is
seen on almost every page of his poetry, and it was in reward of his
services in promoting the study of the former's works that in 1373 he
was invited by Florence to lecture on the Divine Comedy (for the first
time in Italy) in the university.</p>

<p>Boccaccio's character was in many respects an attractive one; he was
honest, sincere, and modest; a faithful friend, a lover of true
literature; and, above all, of a lovable and gentle disposition;
<i>Giovanni della Tranquillità</i>, his friends called him&mdash;"John of the
quiet mind," as we may translate it. The gravest accusation made against
him, and one, alas! only too well founded, is his immorality. In his
early years, and even later in life, his manners were light, and the
effects thereof are too often reflected in his books. Before condemning
him too harshly, however, we must bear in mind the low state of morals
that marked all society at that time. Toward the end of his life
Boccaccio became converted by a strange event. It seems that a certain
Carthusian monk, Pietro de' Petroni&mdash;who, by the austerity of his life
and his religious exaltation, had won a reputation for holiness&mdash;died at
Siena, May 29, 1361. Fourteen days before his death he entered into a
trance, in which he had a vision of the saints in heaven and the damned
in hell. When he awoke he declared that he had been commanded by Christ
to warn a number of distinguished men of the error of their ways. Among
these was Boccaccio. Being too sick to go himself, Petroni sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> his
disciple, Gioachino Ciani, to fulfill his commission. The latter came to
Florence, told Boccaccio of his master's vision, and then, in fiery
language, urged him to see to the salvation of his soul, and to
repudiate his immoral writings, else he would soon die and his soul be
lost forever. Boccaccio was deeply affected by this strange embassy. In
the first moments of depression he resolved to give up all study, burn
his books, write no more, and spend the rest of life in religious
exercises. From this violent action, however, he was saved by a sensible
letter from Petrarch. Yet the effect did not pass away. Ever after this
he was more serious and thought more of religious matters. He lost his
former zest in life; his gaiety and serenity of temper became clouded.
After a youth of enjoyment the evening of life came on gray and cold.</p>

<p>He died December 21, 1375, in Certaldo, not far from Florence.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, like Petrarch, wrote much in Latin, chief among such writings
being the historical or biographical compilations on Illustrious Women
and the Vicissitudes of Great Men, and especially his Genealogy of the
Gods, which for one hundred years and more became the standard hand-book
of mythology. In Italian poetry he was far more voluminous than
Petrarch. Among the best known of his poems are the Vision of Love;
Filostrato, which tells the story of Troilus and Cressida, afterwards
imitated by Chaucer and Shakespeare; and the Theseid, imitated by
Chaucer in his Knight's Tale. His Ninfale Fiesolana describes the
beautiful suburbs of Florence, while his pastoral poem, Ameto, is the
first example of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> popular branch of poetry, which found its highest
development in Sannazaro's Arcadia, Tasso's Aminta, and Guarini's Pastor
Fido.</p>

<p>All these, however, are now almost forgotten. The one book by which
Boccaccio is known to-day, not only in Italy, but the world over, is his
Decameron, a collection of short stories in prose. In this book he
becomes epoch-making in a double sense, for it begins both Italian prose
and the modern novel. The name of the book is composed of two Greek
words, meaning "ten days," and is explained by the fact that there are
one hundred stories in all, told ten at a time, on ten successive days.</p>

<p>Neither the various stories themselves nor the idea of uniting them in a
framework is original with Boccaccio. The latter device was especially
popular in the Orient, and is illustrated in the Seven Wise Men, so
vastly popular in the Middle Ages. Chaucer imitated Boccaccio in this
respect in his Canterbury Tales. The sources of the stories in the
Decameron are various. Such tales were among the most popular kinds of
literature of the times, as may be seen in the Fabliaux in France and
the well-known collections, the Novellino and Cento Novelle, in Italy.
Boccaccio gathers them from all sides and adds many he had heard told
orally, especially anecdotes of his contemporaries. All these are
changed, however, by the alchemy of his own genius, and become original
in style, in delineation of character, and in local color.</p>

<p>The framework of the Decameron is as follows: During the terrible
pestilence which raged in Europe in 1348, a famous description of which
is given in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> opening chapter of the book, seven young ladies and
three young men meet in one of the churches at Florence and agree to
forsake the plague-stricken city, retire to their villas in the country
and try to forget in pleasant converse the terrors that surround them.
The plan is carried out. Each day a leader is chosen, whom all must
obey. After breakfast they betake themselves to the garden, and here on
green lawns covered with flowers, beneath shady trees and beside
clear-running streams, they dance, play, and sing; and then, comfortably
seated on the soft grass, they pass the hours away in cheerful
conversation and story-telling.</p>

<p>Each one of these one hundred stories has an individual character of its
own. While reading them we see passing in picturesque procession before
our eyes the whole of Italian society of the times, kings and princes,
knights and peasants, merchant, artist, mechanic, priest, and monk.
There are not wanting earnest and serious stories, but the comic and
satirical element prevails; especially are the vices of the clergy
scourged, that fruitful source of all European medieval literature. The
avaricious and licentious priests and monks are everywhere held up to
the scornful laughter of his readers.</p>

<p>All this is expressed in an admirable prose style, with perfect
adaptation of local color, with excellent delineation of character and
insight into human nature, and with the inimitable skill in narration of
the born story-teller.</p>

<p>The popularity of Boccaccio was, and is still, enormous, in spite of the
immorality of certain of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> stories. He is read to-day in the
elementary schools of Italy (in emendated editions), and his influence
on modern literature is incalculable. In English literature alone most
of the great writers have found subjects for poems, stories, and dramas
in the Decameron, among them Chaucer, Dryden, Shakespeare, Keats,
Tennyson, and Longfellow.</p>

<p>The following story, which I have translated with some slight
condensation, is not only the best and most famous of the Decameron, but
it illustrates on the one hand the vast antiquity of the short-story
(existing, as it does, not only in all European languages in the Middle
Ages, but running back its roots to the early antiquity of India), and
on the other hand, the influence of Boccaccio, "Patient Griselda" having
become almost a household word in modern literature, and having
furnished themes for poet, painter, and sculptor. John Addington Symonds
has declared that no Greek poem equals Boccaccio's story of Griselda for
tenderness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A long time ago there lived a certain marquis of Saluzzo, named
Walter, who spent his time chiefly in hunting, with never a
thought of marriage. His vassals not liking this state of
affairs often urged him to take to himself a wife, so that in
case of death, he might not be without an heir, nor they without
a master. To all this Walter made answer as follows: "My
friends, you urge me to do that which I had resolved not to do,
considering how difficult it is to find a proper mate, and how
hard is the life of him who finds one not suited to him. Yet
since it pleases you to bind me with these chains, I will
agree&mdash;on this condition, however, that I choose my wife myself,
so that if evil come to me, I may have no one to blame but
myself. But bear this in mind: if you do not honor her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
becomes your lady, you shall prove to your cost how grievous a
thing it is to have forced me to wed against my own desire."</p>

<p>Now for some time past Walter had been much attracted by the
gentle manners of a poor but beautiful village maiden, who lived
near his castle; and it seemed to him that with her he could be
happy. Hence without seeking further he sent for her father, and
agreed with him to take his daughter as his wife. This being
settled, Walter called together his friends and vassals and said
to them: "Friends, it has pleased you to ask me to take to
myself a wife, and I have yielded, more to please you, however,
than through any desire of my own. You will remember that you
agreed to be satisfied and treat as your lady whomsoever I
should choose. The time has now come when I intend to keep my
promise, and I desire that you keep yours. I have found a young
lady to my liking whom I intend to marry, and I shall bring her
home in a few days. See to it that the wedding feast be a fair
one and that you receive her honorably." The good men, all
rejoicing, answered that they were indeed pleased, and that
whoever his bride might be, they would honor her in all things
as their lady.</p>

<p>After this Walter prepared a bountiful wedding feast and invited
thereto his many friends and relatives and all the gentle folk
round about. He had many rich and beautiful gowns made fit to
adorn the figure of the young girl whom he proposed to wed; and
likewise rings, and girdles, and a fair rich crown, in short all
things that a new bride might require.</p>

<p>Now when the day fixed for the wedding had come, Walter mounted
his horse and said to his followers: "Gentlemen, it is time to
go for the bride." And setting out with all his company he came
to the village, and the house of the young girl's father, where
they found her returning in great haste from the fountain, in
order that she, with the other women-folk of the village, might
go and see the coming of their lord's bride. When Walter saw her
he called her by name&mdash;that is, Griselda&mdash;and asked her where
her father was; to whom she answered shamefacedly, "My lord, he
is in the house." Then Walter dismounted, and ordering his
followers to remain outside, went alone into the humble cottage,
where he found her father&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> name was Giannùcolo&mdash;and said
to him: "I have come to wed Griselda; but first I wish to ask
her something in your presence." And he asked her if she would
always try to please him, if he took her for his wife; and if
she would promise not to be angry, whatever he might say or do;
and many other similar things; to all of which she made answer:
"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>Then Walter, taking her by the hand, led her outside, and having
called for the gowns he had prepared, he had her clothed
therewith, and upon her head he placed a crown, and then as all
present marveled mightily, he said: "My lords, this is she whom
I intend shall be my wife"; and then turning to her who stood
blushing and full of wonder, he said: "Griselda, will you take
me for your husband?" To which she answered as before, "Yes, my
lord." "Then," said he, "I will take you for my wife"; and in
presence of all he wed her, and setting her upon a palfrey, he
led her home.</p>

<p>The young bride was, as we have already said, beautiful in face
and person, and withal so attractive, pleasing, and
gentle-mannered, that she did not seem to have been a
shepherdess, but the daughter of a noble lord; so that she made
all those who had known her before, to marvel greatly. Moreover,
she was so obedient to her husband, and so attentive to his
comfort, that he held himself the happiest man in the world. In
similar manner she was so kind and gracious towards her
husband's subjects that they loved and honored her one and all,
always praying for her health and happiness.</p>

<p>Shortly after the birth of his first child, a daughter, a
strange fancy entered the mind of Walter, and he resolved to
prove the patience and obedience of his wife, by subjecting her
to many cruel trials. In the first place, he wounded her spirit
by harsh words, feigning to be much disturbed in mind, and
declaring that his vassals were ill-content with her on account
of her low birth, and especially now that they saw that she bore
children; wherefore they were sullen and did nothing but murmur.
Hearing which words, Griselda, without changing countenance,
said: "My lord, do with me as you think best for your own honor
and happiness, and I will be content; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> know I was not
worthy of all this honor to which you, by your courtesy, have
brought me." This answer was very pleasing to Walter, who thus
saw that her new honors had not puffed her up with pride.</p>

<p>A short time after, having said to his wife that his subjects
could not endure her daughter, he sent one of his servants to
her who, with mournful countenance, said, "My lady, if I would
not die, I must do that which my lord commands me. He has
ordered me to take your little daughter and to&mdash;&mdash;" and he said
no more. The lady, hearing these words, and seeing the face of
the servant, and remembering the words of her husband, believed
that the servant had been ordered to kill her child; whereupon
quickly taking the little one from the cradle, she kissed and
prayed over it, with unchanged countenance, in spite of the
great sorrow she felt in her heart; and placing it in the arms
of the servant, said: "Here, do what thy lord and mine has
commanded thee to do. But see to it that the child be not
devoured by birds or wild beasts, unless indeed he commands thee
so to do."</p>

<p>The servant took the girl and reported to Walter what the lady
had said. He, marveling greatly at her constancy, sent both
servant and child to a certain lady in Bologna, a relative of
his, begging her to bring it up and educate it carefully,
without, however, revealing its parentage.</p>

<p>Some years after this Griselda gave birth to a son, to the great
joy of Walter. But not being satisfied with what he already had
done, he wounded Griselda's feelings still more, saying to her
one day, "My lady, since this our child was born, I have not
been able to live with my subjects, so bitterly do they rebel
against the thought that some day a grandson of Giannùcolo shall
rule over them. Wherefore, if I do not wish to be driven out, I
shall have to leave you and take another wife." Griselda heard
these words with patient mind, and only answered: "My lord, do
you think how you may best satisfy your own pleasure; have no
thought concerning me, for I desire only to see you happy."</p>

<p>A few days after, Walter sent for the son as he had done for the
daughter before, and feigning again to have it slain, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> sent
it to Bologna to be brought up together with his daughter. At
all of which Griselda made no other sign, nor said anything more
than she had done when her daughter had been taken away. And
once more Walter marveled to himself and declared that no other
woman could do what she did, for he knew well that she loved her
children dearly. His vassals, believing that he had put his
children to death, blamed him strongly as a most cruel man, and
had great compassion on their lady. She, however, never
complained, but said always to those who condoled with her on
the loss of her children, that what seemed good to their father
seemed good to her.</p>

<p>Many years after the birth of his daughter, Walter, thinking it
time to make a final test of Griselda's long suffering, declared
openly that he could endure her no longer as his wife, and that
he had acted as a foolish boy when he had taken her. Wherefore
he would now make overtures to the pope for leave to divorce
her, and take another wife. The lady, hearing these things, and
foreseeing that she should have to return to her father's house,
and perchance keep sheep as before, seeing another woman married
to him whom she loved so much, grieved deeply in her heart.
Nevertheless, as in the other blows of fortune, she disposed
herself to bear this also with firm countenance.</p>

<p>Not long after, Walter caused false letters to come from Rome,
and told his subjects that the pope had granted him a
dispensation to leave Griselda and take a new wife. Then calling
her before him in the presence of many others, he said to her:
"Griselda, by special dispensation granted me by the pope, I am
able now to leave you and take another wife; and inasmuch as my
ancestors have been great gentlemen and lords of this country,
while yours have always been laborers, I intend that you shall
no longer be my wife, but shall return to your father's house,
bearing with you the dowry which you brought." Hearing these
words, Griselda, with the greatest difficulty, kept back her
tears, being in this stronger than the common run of women, and
answered: "My lord, I have always known that my humble condition
was in no wise suited to your exalted rank; and what I have been
to you, I recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> as coming from God and your courtesy. Nor
have I ever regarded all these honors as given to me, but only
loaned. If it please you then to take them back, it is my duty
to be willing to give them up. Here is the ring with which you
married me; take it."</p>

<p>Walter, who had more desire to weep than anything else, stood
there with hard face and said: "Go, but see to it that you take
with you one garment only." Whereupon she, dressed in a single
garment, barefooted and bareheaded, left her husband's castle,
and returned to her father, followed by the tears and compassion
of all who saw her. Giannùcolo, who had never been quite able to
believe that Walter could be content to take his daughter as his
wife, and who expected her return every day, had kept her
clothes which she had put off on the morning of her marriage.
Now Griselda put them on again and gave herself up to the little
duties of her father's house, bearing the cruel assaults of
hostile fortune with firm mind.</p>

<p>In the meantime Walter declared to his vassals that he had
chosen for his wife the daughter of a certain count of Panago
(who was the husband of the lady in Bologna, to whom he had sent
his children); and ordering great preparations for the wedding
to be made, he sent for Griselda, and when she had come, he
said: "I am about to bring home the lady whom I have chosen for
my wife. You know that I have no one here who can arrange all
the things needful for so great a feast. Wherefore do you put
everything in order, and call in to help you the women you think
best, and receive them as if you were still the lady here. Then
after the wedding is all over you may return home."</p>

<p>Although these words were like so many stabs to the heart of
Griselda, who could not lay aside her love for him as easily as
she had laid aside her good fortune, she answered: "My lord, I
am ready." And dressed in her peasant costume, she entered the
house, whence she had shortly before gone forth, and began to
sweep and put in order the rooms, and to prepare the food,
setting her own hands to everything as if she were but a common
servant of the house. Nor did she rest till all was properly
arranged and prepared for the wedding. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> then, inviting in
the name of Walter all the ladies of the country round about,
she began to prepare the feast, and when the wedding day had
come, although she was dressed in coarse garments, she received
all the ladies who came with ladylike bearing and smiling face.</p>

<p>Walter, who had caused his children to be diligently brought up
in Bologna in the house of his relative, wife of the count of
Panago (his son being six years old and his daughter twelve, the
latter being the most beautiful creature ever seen), had sent to
the count of Panago, begging him to bring his children to
Saluzzo, and to say to all that the girl was to marry Walter.
The count did as he was requested, and with the two children and
a noble company arrived about noon at Saluzzo, where all the
peasants and neighbors from round about were waiting for the new
bride. She was received by the ladies, and Griselda, dressed as
she was, came forward to meet her cheerfully, saying: "Welcome
to my lady."</p>

<p>Walter, who now thought he had sufficient evidence of the
long-suffering of his wife, called her to him, and in the
presence of all, said to her: "What think you of our bride?" "My
lord," said Griselda, "she seems fair indeed to look upon; and
if she is as wise as beautiful, which I well believe, I doubt
not that you will live with her the happiest gentleman in the
world. But I beseech you for one thing: do not wound her spirit,
as you have that of your other wife. For I do not believe she
can stand it, young as she is, and so delicately brought up."</p>

<p>Walter, seeing that she firmly believed the girl was to be his
wife, and that yet she spoke thus kindly of her, set her down
beside him, and said: "Griselda, it is time now that you receive
the rewards of your patience, and that those who have reputed me
cruel, may know that what I did was to teach you how to be a
wife, and to prepare for myself a life of perpetual peace and
quiet with you as my loving and faithful companion. Therefore
take with joyful mind this girl, whom you thought to be my
bride, and her brother, for your children and mine. These are
they whom you and many others long have thought I had cruelly
slain. I am your husband, who love you above all things else;
and I indeed can boast that no other man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> so great reason to
be content with his wife as I;" and thus speaking he embraced
and kissed her, and raising her who was now weeping for joy, he
led her to where the daughter sat, listening in amazement to all
these things, and embraced her and her brother tenderly. Then
all the ladies, rejoicing greatly, rose from the table and went
with Griselda to her room, and dressed her in a rich gown, such
as befitted a lady, which she ever seemed, even in her rags, and
led her back again to the hall, and then all, rejoicing,
continued the feast. The count of Panago went back to Bologna,
and Walter, taking Giannùcolo from his work-shop, kept him in
state as his father-in-law, so that he lived in great comfort
and honor to the end of his life. And the marquis himself,
having found his daughter a noble husband, lived long and
happily with Griselda, holding her ever in love and esteem. </p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE RENAISSANCE AND ARIOSTO</p>


<p>We have seen that Petrarch is considered the founder of the Renaissance
in Italy. He died in 1374, and it took a century and more to complete
the work he inaugurated. The whole of the fifteenth century is of
importance in the history of Italian literature, not so much for what it
produced, as for the fact that it prepared the way for the so-called
"Golden Age" of the sixteenth century. During these hundred years
classical scholarship became more and more widely diffused, being no
longer confined to a few cities or princely courts, but spread over all
Italy and through all classes of society.</p>

<p>Yet Florence still remained the great center of this influence. Under
the powerful family of the Medici the city had risen to great power and
prosperity, and amid all the political confusion of the times it
continued to be characterized by a keen intellectual and æsthetic life.
The immediate successors of Petrarch and Boccaccio in the spread of the
new learning, Luigi Marsili and Coluccio Salutati, lived and worked at
Florence. Later came Poggio Bracciolini, who equaled Petrarch himself as
an eager and successful collector of manuscripts; Marsilio Ficino, who
founded under Cosimo de' Medici the famous Platonic academy; Pico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> della
Mirandola, the youthful prodigy of learning and mystical enthusiast; and
Politian, the greatest scholar and most elegant poet of his day. These
men studied not only Latin as Petrarch had done, but obtained a good
knowledge of Greek. They plunged eagerly into the study of Plato, who
for so many centuries had been unknown to western Europe, and who now
threatened to take the place of Aristotle in the world of philosophy.
They gathered statues, coins, and inscriptions, and studied ruins in
order to obtain as clear an idea as possible of the ancient world. It is
hard for us to-day to get an idea of the eager enthusiasm and intense
delight in study of these men of the Renaissance; they must have felt as
Wordsworth did when he cried out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be young was very heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The scholars of the time enjoyed an immense popularity. A new caste of
society arose, not dependent on birth or wealth, but on learning and
intelligence. Princes and cities sought for their services, for which
they paid large sums. Everywhere they were received as equal to the
noblest in the land. The movement reached its highest point in the first
half of the sixteenth century, when the intellectual and artistic life
of Italy was of almost incredible greatness. In proof of this statement
we need only mention a few names, such as Michel Angelo, Raphael,
Leonardo da Vinci, Ariosto, and Macchiavelli; Tasso belongs to the same
group, though born out of due season.</p>

<p>Naturally enough the early Humanists wrote for the most part in Latin,
which they still looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> as the language of their ancestors and
thus, in a certain sense, their mother-tongue. Indeed, many at first
despised the vernacular as a base corruption. Later, however, a reaction
set in; the example of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio induced others to
write in Italian, which now became more and more polished and adapted to
become the medium of a great literature. This new impulse toward a
national literature was first given at Florence, at the court of Lorenzo
the Magnificent, who himself, next to Politian, was the greatest poet of
his day. We cannot linger, however, over these fifteenth century
writers, but must hasten on to the next century and to the consideration
of Ariosto, the supreme poet of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>In discussing the romantic poetry of Ariosto, however, we must go back a
number of years in order to get the proper perspective. Among the
brilliant men of letters of the court of the Medici was a certain Luigi
Pulci, of a poor but noble family. It was he who was the first to
introduce into elegant literature the old romances of the Carlovingian
cycle, which for centuries had been sung and recited by rude, wandering
minstrels in the public streets of Italy.</p>

<p>We have seen in Chapter I. how in the thirteenth century the old French
<i>chansons de gestes</i> had been introduced into North Italy and had there
become popular; these had been rewritten and worked over in rude forms
for the amusement of the common folk, but up to the time of Pulci had
found no place in literature proper. Now it is the glory of Pulci to
have brought this popular material into the realm of artistic poetry.
This he is said to have done at the request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> of Lorenzo's mother, the
result being the poem known as Morgante. In this poem Pulci introduces
as the chief character Orlando, the Italian form of Roland, the nephew
of Charlemagne, and the hero of Roncesvalles, who plays so large a rôle
in the French romances. The title is derived from the name of a giant
whose life has been saved by Orlando, whom he, in gratitude therefor,
follows as a faithful servant; he drops out of the story in the
twentieth canto.</p>

<p>Pulci, in his Morgante, follows closely the popular poetry of his
predecessors, but differs from them in language, style, and especially
in the comic treatment of his theme; in all these respects he is the
forerunner of Boiardo and Ariosto. As we have seen, he was a native of
Florence, which, up to the end of the fifteenth century, had been the
chief center of the literary glory of Italy. The scene now changes to
Ferrara, where the house of Este had for generations held a brilliant
court. It was here that the three great poets, Boiardo, Ariosto, and
Tasso, lived and produced their works.</p>

<p>Boiardo has been so eclipsed by Ariosto that he is not known as well as
he ought to be, when we consider his services to Italian literature. To
him belongs the credit of having invented the romantic epic, and
Ariosto, who followed in the same lines, added but little to the general
groundwork of his predecessor.</p>

<p>Matteo Maria Boiardo was born of a noble family at Reggio in 1434, and
having early gone to Ferrara, remained there till his death in 1494. A
scholar, poet, administrator, and courtier, his position at the court of
the duke of Este reminds us involuntarily of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> that of Goethe, three
hundred years later, at Weimar. His first essays in literature were in
Latin, but when he was about forty years old he began his poem of
Orlando Innamorato (Roland in Love). He was led naturally thereto.
Ferrara had early favored chivalrous poetry, and the library of the duke
contained a large number of romances, belonging especially to the
Arthurian cycle, which pleased the elegant society of the court more
than the Carlovingian stories so popular with the common people. These
romances of King Arthur and the Round Table, however, were in French.</p>

<p>Boiardo's great merit consists in the fact that he united in one the
various characteristics of both the Carlovingian and the Arthurian
romances, and thus combined the popular and the courtly element. He
chose the characters of his poem from the former, but changed them to
true knights of chivalry, and added all the paraphernalia of the
Arthurian tales. Of especial importance was the introduction of romantic
love as the motive of all action.</p>

<p>The general theme of Orlando Innamorato is the war between Charlemagne
and the Saracens, yet there is no one definite action, as in the case of
the regular epic. Rather the poem consists of a series of independent,
or at least very loosely connected, episodes, in which the adventures of
the various knights errant are recounted with great skill and interest.
Chief among these episodes is that of Orlando and his love for Angelica,
the daughter of the king of Cathay, who comes to the court of
Charlemagne in Paris, and by means of her beauty and coquetry succeeds
in drawing away a number of the best Christian warriors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> Other
important characters are Astolfo, <ins title="Spelled Rodamonte elsewhere.">Rodomonte,</ins> Rinaldo, and the latter's
sister, <ins title="Brandiamante is used elsewhere.">Brandiamente,</ins> who falls in love with the pagan Roger, who,
according to Boiardo, was the founder of the house of Este. Vast as the
poem is in its present state, Boiardo left it only half finished when he
died in 1494.</p>

<p>At the time of Boiardo's death Ludovico Ariosto was a youth of twenty.
Born in Reggio, in 1474, of a family that had long been in the service
of the Este family, he too, after an irregular and tardy education came
to Ferrara and entered the service of the Cardinal Este. At the death of
his father, in 1500, Ariosto found himself at the head of a family of
ten, and nobly performed his duty by caring and providing for all his
brothers and sisters. His position in the household of the cardinal was
not at all to his liking; he was often sent on embassies and business
trips, a function which, to a man who loved quiet and leisure as much as
Ariosto did, was utterly distasteful. In 1517 he refused to accompany
the cardinal to Hungary, on the ground of ill-health, and was thereupon
summarily dismissed. He found soon, however, more congenial employment
in the household of Duke Alfonso. His life now was more quiet and
afforded him more opportunity for study and writing. Yet even here he
was not content. His inclinations were all against court life, and he
only retained his position on account of his poverty. His character, as
depicted in his satires, was very different from that of Petrarch, who
was a successful courtier. Ariosto could not bow and smile and make
himself agreeable. He was sincere and independent by nature, modest in
his desires, kindly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> amiable, loved nature, quiet study, and rural
occupations. In 1527 he succeeded in saving enough to buy a small house
at Ferrara, with a garden attached. Over the door he placed the
inscription which has become famous: "Small, but suited to me; harmful
to no one; bought with my own money." Here he spent the remainder of his
days, happy and contented, amusing himself with almost childish joy in
the cultivation of his garden. He died June 6, 1533.</p>

<p>Ariosto's literary work consists of comedies, which are among the very
first of modern literature; satires and the Orlando Furioso (Mad
Roland). The satires rank next in literary value to his masterpiece, and
are charming examples of the poetic epistle rather than biting satire.
They contain many details of the society of the day, and are our best
source for the life and character of their author. They are all inspired
with kindly humor and full of worldly wisdom and common sense. No one
can read these satires without feeling a respect and affection for the
poet who wrote them.</p>

<p>Ariosto's most famous work, however, is the Orlando Furioso. When he
came to Ferrara everybody was talking about the Orlando Innamorato of
Boiardo. Ariosto himself admired it immensely, for it harmonized
perfectly with his own genius and literary tastes. Hence when there came
to him that mysterious command, "Write," which all men of poetical
genius hear some day or other, it was only natural that he should turn
to the unfinished poem of his predecessor, with the thought of
completing it.</p>

<p>Yet it would be a mistake to think Ariosto was a mere plagiarist or that
he lacked originality. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> writer ever lived who has so impressed his
own individuality on his works as he. He took the data furnished by his
predecessors and joined to them all the culture of the times, ideas,
aspirations, conception of life; all these he fused into one vast work
which reflects the age of the Renaissance as truly as the Divine Comedy
reflects the closing period of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It is practically impossible to give a clear yet brief outline of
Orlando Furioso. It does not, like the Iliad, Æneid, Paradise Lost, and
Jerusalem Delivered, contain one central action, with which all parts
are logically connected, but is rather a vast arena on which take place
many different and independent actions at the same time. The wars
between Charlemagne and the Saracens, which had been begun in Boiardo's
poem, are here continued and carried to an end. In similar manner
Ariosto takes up the history of the various knights errant introduced by
his predecessor, and either continues their adventures or introduces new
ones himself. In the first canto the poet shows us the army of Agramante
before the walls of Paris, in which Charlemagne and his army are shut
up, and in the course of the poem he shows us the city freed, the enemy
defeated, and Christianity saved from the dominion of the Saracen. Yet
this is not the real center of action; often it is entirely lost sight
of in the confusing crowd of individual adventures. It only serves as a
factitious means of joining from time to time the scattered threads of
the various episodes. When the poet does not know what to do with any
particular character, he despatches him forthwith to Paris, there to
await the final dénouement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The individual heroes are free, not bound by any ties of discipline to
Charlemagne; they leave at any moment, in obedience to individual
caprice, and wander forth in search of love and honor. It is in these
various episodes or adventures that the true interest of the poem
resides. At first sight there seems to be an inextricable confusion in
the way they are told; but after careful study we find that the poet
always controls them with a firm hand. A constant change goes on before
our eyes. When one story has been told for some time, the poet, fearing
to weary the reader, breaks it off, always at an interesting point, to
begin another, which, in its turn, yields to another, and this to still
another; from time to time these stories are taken up again, continued,
and finished. All these transitions are marvels of skill and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Among the crowd of minor episodes three stand out with especial
distinctness, the story of Cloridan and Medoro, Angelica's love for the
latter and the consequent madness of Orlando; and the death of Zerbino.</p>

<p>Cloridan and Medoro are two brave young pagans, whose lord and master,
Dardinello, has been slain in battle with Charlemagne's army outside the
walls of Paris. Now the two youths, as they stand on guard at night,
lament that their master's body lies unburied and dishonored on the
field of battle, and resolve to go and find it and bring it back to
camp.</p>

<p>Thus begins the madness of Orlando, who, after performing prodigious
deeds of strength on men, cattle, and trees, is seized with
restlessness, and wanders far and wide:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now right, now left, he wandered, far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Throughout all France, and reached a bridge one day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath which ran an ample water's tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of steep and broken banks: a turret gray<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was builded by the spacious river's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Discerned, from far and near, and every way.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What here he did I shall relate elsewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who first must make the Scottish prince my care.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Scottish prince, to whom the poet refers in these last lines, is the
same Zerbino whom we have left pursuing the wretch who wounded the young
Medoro. Zerbino is young, handsome, and brave, and has married Isabella,
daughter of the king of Gallicia, whom he loves and by whom he is loved
with tender conjugal affection. Now his time has come to die. He, with
Isabella, arrives on the scene of Orlando's madness and finds the
scattered arms of Orlando, which he gathers together and hangs on a
tree, with an inscription telling whose they are, and forbidding all to
touch them. Just then up comes Mandricardo, emperor of Tartary,
accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> Doralice, his lady-love, and attempts to take Orlando's
sword Durindane. The two warriors fight, and Zerbino being fatally
wounded, Doralice, at the prayer of Isabella, prevails on Mandricardo to
end the battle: yet it is too late to save the life of Zerbino.</p>

<p>Neither the wars of Charlemagne nor the madness of Orlando gives a real
unity to the poem; the nearest thing to such a unity is to be found in
the story of Roger and <ins title="Spelled Brandiamente elsewhere.">Brandiamante,</ins> the former a pagan, the latter a
Christian, daughter of Aymon and sister to Rinaldo. They love each
other, seek each other, and after countless adventures by land and sea,
are united in marriage, thus founding the house of Este. It is with
Roger's conversion to Christianity and his marriage that the poem ends.
All the different heroes are gathered together before the walls of
Paris, Orlando's madness has been cured by Astolfo, who has made his
famous visit to the moon, where, in the paradise of fools, he recovers
the lost brain of his friend; Rinaldo, on his wedding day, slays
<ins title="Spelled Rodomonte elsewhere.">Rodamonte,</ins> the truculent and hitherto unconquerable enemy of the
Christians, and with his fall the war and the poem are ended.</p>


<p>Hard as it is to give a clear conception of the complicated adventures
told in the Orlando Furioso, it is perhaps still harder to give an idea
of its charm to these who have not read it. We are introduced at once
into a world of fancy, a sort of fairy-book for grown-up people. The
poem is not deeply impressive like the Divine Comedy, it has no elements
of tragedy. Ariosto did not aim at moral effect, but merely sought to
amuse his readers. Dante represents the deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> mystical religious
feeling of his times; Ariosto represents the worldliness of the
neo-paganism of the Renaissance. The asceticism of the Middle Ages now
gives way to intense delight in the life that now is. The artist and
poet sought to represent the pomp and circumstance of life, man in his
physical and intellectual power, woman in her beauty, nature in all its
picturesque variety, art in its magnificence. This was the ideal
followed by Ariosto; this was the ideal of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>The great charm of Ariosto is his style. Here form reaches its highest
expression. He worked over and polished his verses unceasingly, yet so
natural are they that they seem to have been written spontaneously. The
Orlando is full of beautiful descriptions, of pathetic scenes,
alternating skilfully with humorous ones. Ariosto's humor, however, is
not coarse or grotesque, but refined and elegant. He does not caricature
the stories of chivalry, as Cervantes does in Don Quixote; but living in
a skeptical age he cannot take seriously the creatures of his own fancy,
and accompanies the prodigious deeds of his heroes with a smile of
good-natured irony.</p>

<p>We have already said that Ariosto was a man of good sense. From the
quiet of his own home he looked out upon the ruffled sea of life and
mused on what he saw. His reflections are contained in his satires; but
they likewise add a peculiar and original charm to the Orlando Furioso.
Among the parts most popular with the serious reader are the short
introductions to the various cantos, each containing some wise
reflection, some rule of life, or some kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> satire; this charm is
well known to the genuine lover of Thackeray.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">TASSO</p>


<p>From the beginning of Italian literature to the death of Ariosto nearly
three hundred years had elapsed. In that period four of its greatest
writers had appeared. Yet no literature can attain the highest rank in
which the drama and epic are not represented. Italy hitherto lacked
these two important branches. The Divine Comedy of Dante is, strictly
speaking, not an epic, but forms a class by itself, being an imaginative
journey to the supernatural world, with a record of things seen and
heard therein; Ariosto's Orlando Furioso was a revival of the old
chivalrous romances in a new and elegant form, adapted to the conditions
and taste of his times; a huge fresco, rather than an epic. As we shall
see in the next chapter, comedy and tragedy had to wait nearly two
hundred years after the death of Ariosto before finding worthy
representatives in Alfieri and Goldoni. The regular epic, however, was
given to Italy by Tasso at the end of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The story of Tasso's life is of great though painful interest. It is a
tragedy of suffering like that of Dante; yet how vast the difference
between the two. Dante bore his sufferings with unparalleled nobility of
character, exciting our admiration. Tasso, weak and vacillating by
nature, lives wretched and miserable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> not from the decrees of fortune,
but owing to his unfitness to bear the trials of ordinary life.</p>

<p>He was born March 11, 1544, at Sorrento, near Naples, the son of
Bernardo Tasso, a man of affairs, a courtier and a poet, who, although
of noble family, was forced by straitened circumstances to pass his life
in the service of others. Tasso's education was varied enough; a few
years at a Jesuit school in Naples, an experience which left a lasting
impression on his sensitive and melancholy temperament; then under
private teachers at Rome; and finally, several years of study of law at
the universities of Padua and Bologna. He was compelled to leave the
latter as a result of certain satires against the university
authorities, which he was accused of having written.</p>

<p>The important period of his life begins in 1565, when he went to
Ferrara, then, as in the days of Boiardo and Ariosto, the center of a
rich and brilliant court. His life here for the next seven or eight
years was a prosperous one. Fortune seemed to have showered her fairest
gifts on this young, handsome, and gentle-mannered poet. He was treated
on terms of intimacy by the duke and his sisters, Lucretia and Leonora.
He was accustomed to take his meals with the two ladies, and to them he
read the poetry which he wrote from time to time. It was undoubtedly due
to their influence that he composed his famous pastoral poem, Aminta
(1572-73), full of exquisite pictures of rural life and bathed in an
atmosphere of tender and refined love. This poem had an unprecedented
success and made its author famous throughout all Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after this, however, the first germs of the terrible mental
disease which wrecked his life began to show themselves. For many years
Tasso was made the hero of a romance, in which he was depicted as a
martyr to social caste&mdash;the victim of his own love for a woman beyond
his sphere. According to this romance Tasso fell in love with the sister
of the duke of Ferrara, and for this crime was shut up in prison and
falsely treated as insane. The results of modern scholarship, however,
have dissipated the sentimental halo from the brow of the unfortunate
poet, and reduced his case to one of pathological diagnosis. Leonora was
some ten years older than Tasso, and the affection which at first
undoubtedly existed between them was that of an elder sister and a
younger brother. The duke was not cruel to Tasso, but on the contrary
treated him at first kindly, and only when he was at last worn out by
the vagaries of the poet, did he drop him and bother himself no more
about him.</p>

<p>The secret of Tasso's sufferings and vicissitudes of fortune lay in
himself; he was, during the latter part of his life, simply insane. All
his actions during this period illustrate perfectly the various phases
of the persecution mania, which in his case was aggravated by religious
hallucination. To this terrible mental disease he was predisposed from
early life; his Jesuit education, the mysterious death of his mother
(suspected of having been poisoned), overwork and worriment, and
especially his morbidly sensitive and melancholy temperament, all helped
to prepare the way for the catastrophe that was to darken his life.</p>

<p>The first open manifestations of insanity occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> in 1577 (probably as
the result of a fever), about the time he had finished the first draft
of the Jerusalem Delivered. Very foolishly for a man as sensitive as he
was, he turned over the manuscript of his poem to a number of friends
for suggestions. The heartless criticisms he thus received filled him
with bitterness and fostered the rising irritability of his nascent
disease. He was especially hurt by the brutal and stupid criticism of
the Inquisitor Antoniano, who advised him to cut out all the romantic
episodes, which form the real beauty of the poem. This put into his mind
the thought that the Inquisition might refuse him permission to print
his poem, and made him fear that he might be a heretic. The lessons of
his early teachers, the Jesuits, now began to bear fruit. In 1577,
tormented by religious doubts, he went to the inquisitor of Bologna and
laid his case before him. Although the latter absolved him from his
self-charge of heresy, Tasso was not satisfied. Henceforth religious
fear was added to the fear of assassination&mdash;a double torment to his
soul.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances he became more and more moody and irritable;
he was suspicious of all about him and subject to frequent outbursts of
violence. On the evening of June 17, 1577, he was discoursing of his
troubles to the Princess Lucretia, when he suspected a passing servant
of spying him, and flung a knife at him. In order to prevent further
acts of violence he was shut up, at first in his room, and later in the
monastery of St. Francis, under the care of a physician. On July 27 he
broke the door and escaped. Horsemen were sent after him, but being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
disguised as a peasant, he escaped, and after many adventures, often
begging his way as a common beggar, he reached Sorrento, where, in the
quiet seclusion of his sister's house, surrounded by all the tokens of
her love and sympathy, he enjoyed a short period of rest and peace.</p>

<p>He soon became restless, however, and yearned for the brilliant life of
the court, which presented itself to his fancy, enhanced by the charms
of distance and of those things we have had and lost. He was like a
butterfly, always attracted toward the light that was to destroy him. He
returned to Ferrara, and again ran away, wandering from city to city,
yet finding nowhere a warm welcome. "The world's rejected guest,"
Shelley called him, who knew himself only too well the meaning of these
words.</p>

<p>In February, 1579, Tasso once more returned to Ferrara, this time
without previous warning, and asked to be received by the duke. It was a
singularly unpropitious moment; the duke was then in the midst of
preparations for his marriage with Margaret Gonzaga, his third wife, and
naturally enough the obscure, half-insane poet was neglected. This
neglect completely turned his mind, and losing all self-control he broke
out into violent invectives in the presence of the court. He was
immediately taken out, shut up in the insane asylum of S. Anna, and in
accordance with the barbarous customs of the age in the treatment of the
insane, put in chains. Here he remained in utter misery, a prey to the
double nightmare of his sick brain, fear of death by the assassin's
knife, and of everlasting damnation as a heretic. The letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> which he
wrote by scores during this period are of heartbreaking pathos.</p>

<p>He remained in S. Anna nearly eight years, being released in 1586 at the
solicitation of Prince Vincenzo Gonzaga, brother-in-law of the duke of
Ferrara. From now on to the end, the story of Tasso's life becomes a
mere repetition of melancholy incidents. Once more he went from city to
city, visiting in turn Milan, Florence, Naples, and Rome, and moving
restlessly hither and thither</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like spirits of the wandering wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seek for rest, yet rest can never find."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally fortune seemed about to smile upon him; a faint ray of sunshine
broke through the thick clouds that for so long had hung over his life.
In November, 1594, he was invited to Rome, there to be crowned poet, as
Petrarch had been. The pope assigned him a pension, and it seemed as if
at last some measure of happiness might again be his. It was only a
brief gleam of sunshine, however; the clouds soon closed again, and the
sun of Tasso's life hastened to its setting shrouded in gloom. The
coronation was put off on account of the ill health of Cardinal Cinzio
and the inclemency of the season. In March, 1595, he himself fell sick,
and in April was taken to the monastery of S. Onofrio on the Janiculum
hill. To the monks who came to meet him he uttered the pathetic words:
"My fathers, I have come to die among you." The pope sent his own
physician to attend him, but in vain. The world-weary poet passed away
April 25, 1595. His body lies buried in the adjacent church. The visitor
to-day can still see his room, furnished as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> his lifetime, and on the
wall a copy of his last letter, in which he announces his speedy death.</p>

<p>Tasso's works are comparatively voluminous, and consist of lyrical
poems, the pastoral poem, Aminta, a tragedy, Torrismondo, dialogues,
letters, and the Jerusalem Delivered. In this brief sketch we can only
discuss the latter, by which alone he is known the world over.</p>

<p>Already when only sixteen years old, he had felt the ambition to write a
poem which should combine the merits of the regular epic (such as the
Iliad and Æneid), and the romantic interest of the poems of Boiardo and
Ariosto. His Rinaldo, written when he was only nineteen years old, was
remarkable both on account of the youth of its author and as a promise
of what was to follow. For a number of years after this, however, he
devoted himself almost exclusively to the task of preparing himself, by
reading, study, and thought, to write the great poem which he had in
mind.</p>

<p>His choice of a subject was a happy one. The fear of the Turk at that
time was widespread; the wars between Christian and Saracen, which
filled the old romances, were now occurring again on the eastern borders
of Europe. The Turks had conquered Hungary, and their piratic ships had
ravaged the coast of Italy, often destroying entire populations; a short
time before Sorrento, Tasso's birthplace, had been attacked, and his
sister escaped only by a miracle. Tasso himself must have heard many a
story of the crusades, when a child at Sorrento, where Pope Urban, who
had published the first crusade, was buried. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> choice of the
deliverance of Jerusalem from the unbeliever then was a natural one.</p>

<p>Contrary to the Orlando Furioso, the story of Jerusalem Delivered, is a
simple one. Yet the main plot, <i>i. e.</i>, the military operations of
Godfrey, the various battles, and the final capture of Jerusalem, are
not so effective or interesting as the various romantic episodes
introduced from time to time; the reader to-day is disposed to hurry
over the early cantos and to linger over the beautiful pages which tell
the loves of Tancred and Clorinda, Olindo and Sophronia, Rinaldo,
Armida, and Erminia.</p>

<p>The poem begins with the usual invocation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I sing the pious arms and Chief, who freed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Sepulcher of Christ from thrall profane:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much did he toil in thought, and much in deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much in the glorious enterprise sustain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hell in vain opposed him; and in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Afric and Asia to the rescue poured<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their mingled tribes;&mdash;Heaven recompensed his pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from all fruitless sallies of the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True to the Red-Cross flag his wandering friends restored.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O, thou, the Muse, that not with fading palms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Circlest thy brows on Pindus, but among<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Angels warbling their celestial psalms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hast for thy coronal a golden throng<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of everlasting stars! make thou my song<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lucid and pure; breathe thou the flame divine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into my bosom; and forgive the wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If with grave truth light fiction I combine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes grace my page with other flowers than thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet then plunges into the midst of the action, We learn how the
Christian army has been in Holy Land for six years and had made many
conquests:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Six summers now were past, since in the East<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their high Crusade the Christians had begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nice by storm, and Antioch had they seized<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By secret guile, and gallantly when won,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Held in defiance of the myriads dun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Prest to its conquest by the Persian king;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tortosa sacked, when now the sullen sun<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Entered Aquarius, to breme winter's wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quartered hosts give place, and wait the coming spring.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the spring of the seventh year the archangel Gabriel appears to
Godfrey of Bouillon and orders him to assemble the chiefs of the army
and prepare for a new and vigorous prosecution of the war. Godfrey obeys
and is himself elected commander-in-chief. Then, after a review of the
troops, which furnishes the poet an opportunity of giving a catalogue of
the various Christian forces (after the manner of Homer), the whole army
starts for Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The scene then changes to the Holy City itself, where King Aladine and
his followers are seized with consternation at the news of the advance
of the Christians. We now see the first of the famous episodes of the
Jerusalem Delivered. The Magician Ismeno urges the king to seize a
certain image of the Virgin Mary and shut it up in the royal mosque
(thus converting it into a palladium for Jerusalem). The king does so;
but immediately the image disappears from the mosque. Aladine is wild
with rage and being unable to discover the perpetrator of the outrage,
resolves to destroy all the Christians in the city. Now there was in the
city a beautiful Christian girl:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Of generous thoughts and principles sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amongst them in the city lived a maid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flower of virgins, in her ripest prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Supremely beautiful! but that she made<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Never her care, or beauty only weighed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In worth with virtue; and her worth acquired<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A deeper charm from blooming in the shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lovers she shunned, nor loved to be admired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from their praises turned, and lived a life retired.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although she was unconscious of love herself, there was a noble
Christian youth, Olindo, who had long loved her in secret. Sophronia
resolves to save her people. She makes her way to the king's palace, and
declares that she alone is guilty of having stolen the sacred image from
the mosque.</p>

<span class="i2">Doomed in tormenting fire to die, they lay<br /></span>

<p>At this moment Olindo approaches the spot, and discovering that the
victim is Sophronia, bursts through the crowd, exclaiming that he
himself is the author of the crime. Sophronia appeals to him not to
sacrifice himself for her, but he remains firm until the king, angered
at their apparent scorn of his power, condemns them both to be burned.
Thus both are about to die, when a knight appears:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In midst of their distress, a knight behold,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Which for a badge is borne, attracts all eyes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A noted cognizance, the accustomed crest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Used by Clorinda, whence conjectures rise,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Yet, though she left the gay and gilded room<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the free camp, kept spotless as the light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her virgin fame, and proud of glory's plume,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pride her aspect armed; she took delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern to appear, and stern, she charmed the gazer's sight.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the first appearance of Clorinda, who is destined to play so
large a part in the poem, and who shows the nobility of her character by
interceding for the lovers with the king. The king, delighted at having
so powerful an auxiliary in his hour of danger and need, willingly
grants Clorinda's request, and the lovers are saved.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Christian army approach Jerusalem, which they reach
at early dawn, and which they greet with deep emotion:</p>

<p>Erminia, daughter of the deceased king of Antioch, points out to King
Aladine from a high tower the famous warriors among the Christians, and
especially praises Tancred, who had conquered her father and taken her
prisoner, and who, by his courtesy and gentle treatment, had won her
love. A sortie is made from the city, and Tancred, finding himself
engaged in battle with Clorinda, whom he esteems a man, breaks her
helmet, and discovering her to be the maiden whom he loves, refuses to
fight further with her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile Clorinda rushes to assail<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Loose to the charmed winds her golden tresses flow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus begins the most famous episode of the Jerusalem Delivered. For the
next half of the poem Tancred and Clorinda are the real hero and
heroine.</p>

<p>In the meantime Satan has called together his followers for
consultation. Among the many plans for holding the Christian army in
check is the sending of the beautiful enchantress Armida to the camp of
Godfrey, where she succeeds by her wiles in drawing away from the army a
number of the bravest warriors. The king of Egypt, with an immense army,
announces his intention to help Jerusalem and from this time on, this
menace hovers like a black cloud over the horizon of the poem, ever
approaching nearer and nearer, till in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> the last canto the storm is
averted by the bravery of the Christian warriors and the aid of heaven.</p>

<p>Argantes, one of the pagan warriors of Jerusalem, sends a herald to
Godfrey's camp, challenging any of his warriors to single combat.
Tancred is appointed by Godfrey to accept the challenge, and the two
doughty champions fight all day long with no result. When night comes on
both retire, bearing away serious wounds. Erminia, who has been in a
terrible state of anxiety during the combat, cannot rest content when
night comes on, without learning the condition of Tancred's wounds. She
puts on Clorinda's suit of armor, leaves the city, and makes her way to
the Christian camp, first sending a messenger to Tancred, announcing
that a lady desires to see him. The scene which follows is very
picturesque, describing as it does the silence of the night and the
distant view of the tents.</p>

<span class="i2">Ah, little does she think, while thus she dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What is prepared for her by Fortune's spite!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Two sentinels see her, and believing her to be Clorinda, pursue her. She
flies and is carried by her horse many miles away, finally reaching a
shepherd's cottage on the banks of the Jordan, where for some time she
takes up her abode far from war's alarms and the "pangs of despised
love." The description of Erminia's life here is much admired for its
delineations of the charm of rural life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">In the fresh shade, his white flocks feeding near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twig baskets wove, and listened to the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trilled by three blooming boys, who sate disporting round.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The shepherd, pitying Erminia's distress, takes her to his wife, and she
thus becomes a member of the humble but happy household.</p>

<p>In the meantime many events are taking place between the Christians and
pagans, sorties, single combats, and attacks on the walls of the city.
Godfrey has caused powerful engines of war to be built, especially a
mighty movable tower, so high that it overtops the walls of the city.
Clorinda, eager for glory, undertakes one night to destroy the tower, in
spite of the warning of her old servant Arsetes, who tells her the story
of her birth, and reveals the fact that she is of Christian parentage.
She issues forth, succeeds in setting fire to the tower, but not being
able to reënter the city, flies, followed by Tancred, who not
recognizing her, fights with her and to his own eternal sorrow, slays
her. This passage is regarded as the most beautiful of the whole poem:</p>

<span class="i0">"Heaven gleams; in blissful peace behold thy friend depart!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A paleness beauteous as the lily's mixt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the sweet violet's, like a gust of wind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flits o'er her face; her eyes on Heaven are fixt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And heaven on her returns its looks as kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Speak she can not; but her cold hand, declined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In pledge of peace on Tancred she bestows;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to her fate thus tenderly resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In her meek beauty she expires, and shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as a smiling saint indulging soft repose.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Clorinda, being dead, Tancred has little desire to live, but is
comforted by a vision of her in heaven:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And, clad in starry robes, the maid for whom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He mourned, appears amid his mourning dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fairer than erst, but by the deathless bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And heavenly radiance that around her beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Graced, not disguised; in sweetest act she seems<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To stoop, and wipe away the tears that flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From his dim eyes: "Behold what glory streams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Round me," she cries; "how beauteous now I show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for my sake, dear friend, this waste of grief forego."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Up to this time the most prominent characters in the poem have been
Tancred and Clorinda. This state of things now changes and the real
hero, Rinaldo, who like Achilles has long been absent from the field of
action, reappears and brings matters to a climax.</p>

<p>We have already seen how Armida has come to camp and carried off a
number of the Christian warriors. At the same time Rinaldo had, in a
contest for the successor of Dudo (killed in the first skirmish between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the crusaders and the pagans), slain Gernando in the presence of the
whole army, and was forced to fly the wrath of Godfrey. He, after having
freed the fifty knights from the power of Armida, is himself caught by
her wiles, and carried off by her to a gorgeous palace situated in the
midst of a beautiful garden, on a high mountain in the island of
Teneriffe. Here, lost in luxury and idleness, he sleeps out the thought
of his duty as a Christian warrior.</p>

<p>In the meantime Godfrey, by various supernatural tokens, learns that
Rinaldo alone can bring about the final success of the Christian arms.
He is thus induced to pardon his crime, which indeed had in a certain
sense been justified, and sends two messengers to bring him back. These
embark on a magic vessel, traverse the Mediterranean, pass the strait of
Gibraltar, enter the Atlantic, and reach the island of Teneriffe. The
descriptions of this voyage and the allusion to Columbus, are famous and
well deserve to be quoted, if we had the space. It is especially
interesting to compare this fictitious voyage into the Atlantic Ocean
with that of Ulysses in Dante's Inferno, the one written before, the
other shortly after the discovery of America.</p>

<p>The ambassadors arrive at the island, climb the mountain, overcome all
obstacles, enter the enchanted garden, and discover Rinaldo, surrounded
by all the beauty of nature and magnificence of art.</p>

<p>The messengers succeed in arousing the dormant nobility of Rinaldo; he
tears himself away, follows them to the camp of Godfrey, is pardoned by
the latter, succeeds in breaking the spell of the enchanted forest, and
thus prepares the way for the building of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> new war machines. The city
then is assaulted and taken, and finally the Egyptian army, which now
appears on the scene, is defeated and the poem ends.</p>

<p>The literature of the Italian Renaissance, which was inaugurated by
Petrarch and Boccaccio, reached its highest point with Ariosto. Tasso,
equally great with Ariosto, lived at the beginning of a long period of
decline; the Jerusalem Delivered projecting the last rays of the glories
of the Renaissance into this new period. The sixteenth century,
especially the first half, is the golden age of Italian literature,
comparable to that of Augustus in Rome, Louis XIV. in France, and Queen
Elizabeth in England. In the narrow confines of this sketch we have only
been able to treat in some detail the great writers thereof, Boiardo,
Ariosto, and Tasso. Yet the number of men of genius and talent is
legion&mdash;giants indeed lived in those days&mdash;not only in the field of art
and scholarship but in literature. In lyrical poetry were Pietro Bembo,
the Petrarch of his times; Michel Angelo and Vittoria Colonna. In the
pastoral poem, besides Tasso, there were Sannazaro and Guarini, the
former (whose Arcadia was imitated in England by Sidney and Spenser) on
the border-line between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the
latter on that between the sixteenth and seventeenth. In comic poetry
there was Francesco Berni, who worked over Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato,
which has since then been read almost wholly in this version. In prose
was developed an especially rich literature, among the great masters of
which we may mention in history, Nicholas Machiavelli, who, in his
Prince, introduced a new philosophy of politics;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> Guicciardini, Varchi,
and Nardi; in the history of art, Vasari; in novels and stories, Luigi
da Porto, who first told the story of Romeo and Juliet; Giraldo Cinzio,
Matteo Bandello, who continued the work of Boccaccio and Sacchetti.
Forming a special group are Benvenuto Cellini, whose autobiography has
made him famous; Firenzuola, who wrote on the beauty of woman;
Baldasarre Castiglione, the Lord Chesterfield of his day, who in his
book on the Courtier, depicted the character of the perfect gentleman
according to the ideals of the times.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">THE PERIOD OF DECADENCE AND THE REVIVAL</p>


<p>In the history of Italian literature, Dante, to expand a figure already
used, stands at the end of the Middle Ages like a lofty, solitary
mountain peak; behind him the low, level plain fades away into darkness;
before him the landscape, shone upon by the first rays of a new epoch,
slopes gradually upward until with Petrarch, Boccaccio, and the great
writers of the Renaissance, we have a lofty and widely extended plateau.
After Tasso there is a sudden descent to a low, level, uniform plain, in
which Italian literature dragged itself along till the middle of the
eighteenth century, when again an upward slope is noticed, which becomes
more and more accentuated as we approach the present.</p>

<p>Among the causes of the period of degradation, from 1560 to 1750, the
leading ones must be sought for in the political and religious condition
of Italy at that time. Spain had become possessed of a large part of the
country, especially in the north and south, while the pope, who ruled
the center, in temporal as well as spiritual matters, was the firm ally
of the Spaniards. The country thus under foreign dominion, was oppressed
and robbed without mercy. The Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> viceroys, and their ignoble
imitators, the Italian nobles, lived a life of luxury and vice,
surrounded by bandits and brigands, and by paralyzing all commerce and
industry, brought on famine and pestilence.</p>

<p>The religious condition was no better. The Catholic reaction, or counter
reformation, which culminated in the Council of Trent, fastened still
more firmly the chains of medieval superstition and dogmatism on the
mass of the Italian people. The absolute power of the pope was
reaffirmed; two mighty instruments were forged to crush out heresy and
opposition&mdash;the Inquisition, which effectually choked out free thought,
and the Jesuits, who found their way stealthily into all ranks and
classes of society. Such was the condition of Italy at this time, "a
prolonged, a solemn, an inexpressibly heartrending tragedy." The effect
on the social life of Italy was almost fatal. Everywhere, to use the
almost exaggerated language of Symonds, were to be seen idleness,
disease, brigandage, destitution, ignorance, superstition, hypocrisy,
vice, ruin, pestilence, "while over the Dead Sea of social putrefaction
floated the sickening oil of Jesuit hypocrisy."</p>

<p>No wonder that in such a state of society, literature and art reached
the lowest point in all its history. Scarcely a single man of genius or
even of talent, can be found in the period between 1580 and 1750. All
literature was marked by lack of originality of thought and by a style
deformed by execrable taste, a style which consisted of wretched
conceits, puns, antithesis, and gorgeous and far-fetched metaphors. This
form of literary diction was not confined, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> to Italy, being
represented in Spain by Gongora, in France by the Hôtel de Rambouillet,
and in England by Lyly's Euphues. In Italy it is known as Marinism from
the poet Marini, whose Adone (in which is told the love of Venus for
Adonis, a subject previously treated by Shakespeare) exemplifying all
phases of the above-mentioned style, had enormous popularity not only in
Italy but abroad.</p>

<p>During the period now under discussion, poets were not wanting, for the
defect was in quality rather than quantity. Yet not all were entirely
without merit, for some possessed a certain degree of talent, especially
in the musical elements of their verse. Such were the lyrical poets,
Chiabrera, Testi, and Filicaja. In prose literature a better and saner
style prevailed, especially in the dialogues of Galileo, and in the
historical and critical writings of Sarpi and Vico.</p>

<p>In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended Spanish rule in Italy, and
the breath of free thought from England sweeping across the plains of
France entered Italy and gradually weakened the power of the Jesuits,
dissipated to a certain extent superstition and ignorance, and aroused
the country to a sense of its degradation. By bringing Italy into
connection with other nations, and with newer ideas, it planted the
germs of a new intellectual life. The influence of France, England, and
Germany began to make itself felt. Corneille, Racine, and Voltaire
influenced Italian tragedy, while Molière, who himself had borrowed
largely from the early Italian comedies, now returned the favor by
becoming the master of Goldoni. English influence came later, first
Addison, Pope, and Milton, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> toward the end of the eighteenth
century, Young, Gray, Shakespeare, and Ossian. Last of all came the
German influence, especially Klopstock and Goethe.</p>

<p>In this period of awakening the chief gain was in the field of the
drama. Up to the middle of the eighteenth century, Italy, in this branch
of literature, could not even remotely be compared with France, Spain,
or England. In the sixteenth century comedies had not been wanting, and
beside the purely Italian creation of improvised farce (now represented
in Punch and Judy shows, pantomimes, and harlequinades), Ariosto had
written literary comedies in close imitation of Plautus and Terence.
Yet, from Ariosto to Goldoni we find practically but one genuine writer
of comedy; this singularly enough, was Machiavelli, whose Mandragora was
enormously popular, and was declared by Voltaire to be better than
Aristophanes and but little inferior to Molière. But one book does not
make a literature any more than one swallow makes a summer. It was left
for Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793) to give his country a number of comedies
worthy of being compared with those of Molière. Goldoni was a kindly,
amiable man of the world as well as of letters, bright and witty but
withal somewhat superficial. Although a keen observer of the outer form
of society and human nature, he lacked the depth and insight, and
especially the subtle pathos of Molière. He was greatly influenced by
the latter, whom he looked upon as his master. Like him he began with
light comedy, farcical in nature, and gradually produced more and more
comedies of manner and character. Yet he is not a slavish imitator of
the great Frenchman, to whom, while inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> in earnestness and
knowledge of the human heart, he was equal in dialogue, in development
of plot, and in comic talent. Goldoni composed rapidly (once he wrote
sixteen comedies in a year), and has left behind him one hundred and
sixty plays and eighty musical dramas and opera texts.</p>

<p>The musical drama is a peculiar Italian invention, and almost
immediately reached perfection in Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782), after
whom it began rapidly to decline. Metastasio was universally admired and
was, before Goldoni and Alfieri, the only Italian that had a European
reputation, and who thus won some measure of glory for his country in
her period of deepest degradation. His plays, meant to be set to
music&mdash;the modern opera text is a debased form of this&mdash;were
superficial, had no real delineation of character, yet were written in
verses which flowed softly along like a clear stream through flowery
meads. Light, artificial in sentiment, often lax in morals, yet
expressing the courtly conventionalities of the times, Metastasio's
poetry enjoyed vast popularity, while he himself became the favorite of
the aristocratic society of Vienna, where he lived for fifty years, and
the pride and glory of Italy. After him music became the all-important
element in this peculiar form of drama, which thus became the modern
opera, while the poetical element was degraded to the text thereof.</p>

<p>More famous, perhaps, than either the above was Alfieri, the founder of
modern Italian tragedy. In the intellectual movement of the sixteenth
century, tragedy, like comedy, had not been neglected, and many
translations and imitations had been made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> the Greek and Latin
dramatists. The first regular tragedy, not only of Italian but of modern
European literature, was the Sofonisba of Trissino, which became the
model of all succeeding writers. Published first in 1524 it was soon
translated into all European languages and has been imitated, among many
others, by Corneille and Voltaire in France, Alfieri in Italy, and
Geibel in Germany. In spite of this promising beginning, however,
Italian tragedy did not develop as that of the neighboring countries
did. Among the numberless writers of tragedy in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries scarcely one deserves mention. In the early part
of the eighteenth century one name became famous, Scipio Maffei
(1675-1755) the immediate predecessor of Alfieri, whose Merope was
vastly popular throughout all Europe.</p>

<p>Yet Italy could not boast of a truly national drama before the
appearance of Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803), who gave her an honorable
rank in this department of the world's literature. The story of his
life, as told by himself in his autobiography, is exceedingly
interesting. Born in Asti, near Turin, of a noble family, after a youth
spent in idleness, ignorance, and selfish pleasure, he "found himself,"
at the age of twenty-six, and being fired with ambition to become a
poet, he began a long period of self-education, in which he made
especial effort to master the Italian language, which he, born in
Piedmont, and long absent abroad, only half understood. The rest of his
life was spent in this study and in writing his dramas.</p>

<p>In his reform of the Italian drama, Alfieri did not, like Manzoni later,
try to introduce Shakesperean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> methods. He went back to the tragic
system of the Greeks and tried to improve on the French followers of the
latter. He observed the three unities, especially that of action, even
more strictly than Corneille or even Racine. Hence his plays are
extraordinarily short (only one is of more than fifteen hundred lines).
The action moves on swiftly to the climax with no effort at mere
dramatic situation or stage effect.</p>

<p>Of especial interest are the subjects of Alfieri's tragedies, all of
them having a political or social tendency. They all express the
theories of the French philosophers then so popular in Italy, concerning
freedom and the rights of the people in opposition to the divine right
of kings. His heroes&mdash;Virginius, Brutus, Timoleon&mdash;all proclaim the
liberty of man. It is interesting to note that he dedicated one of his
plays to George Washington. To the reader of the present day even his
best plays&mdash;Virginia, Orestes, Agamemnon, Myrra, and Saul&mdash;seem
conventional, monotonous, and unreal. The characters are mere types of
passion or sentiment; there is no variety of action, no episodes, and no
poetical adornments. Yet in his own age Alfieri was regarded as a great
tragic poet, not only in his own country, but beyond the Alps. His
influence on Italian literature was very great. For the next two
generations there was scarcely a poet who did not admire and imitate
him. Parini, Foscolo, Monti, Manzoni, Leopardi, and Pellico, all looked
up to him as their master.</p>

<p>Alfieri was the first to speak of a fatherland, a united Italy; he
practically founded the patriotic school of literature which has lasted
down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> present time. Hence he is even more important from a
political standpoint than from a literary one. He himself looked on his
tragedies as a means of inspiring new and higher political ideas in his
fellow-countrymen, degraded as they had been by the long oppression of
Spain. "I wrote," he says, "because the sad conditions of the times did
not allow me to act."</p>

<p>The literature of the first half of the nineteenth century was dominated
by this political and patriotic spirit; Monti, Foscolo, Manzoni, and
Pellico, all wrote dramas in the spirit of Alfieri. Most of them,
however, are better known in other accounts. Foscolo, through his
letters of Jacopo Ortis, the Italian Werther, and his literary essays;
Pellico for his My Prisons; Manzoni for his Betrothed, one of the great
novels of modern times.</p>

<p>Greater than all of these, however, is Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), who
alone is worthy to be placed beside the four great Italian poets, Dante,
Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, the last three of whom, at least, he might
under happier circumstances have equaled. The story of his life is a
pathetic one. Born of a family noble but poor, with a sensitive and
melancholy temperament, the circumstances of his life only added to his
morbid tendency, and after a brief existence, passed in sickness,
poverty, and gloom, he died. Leopardi was great as a poet, a
philosopher, and scholar. His Ode to Italy is one of the noblest poems
in the language, and his Solitary Shepherd of Asia, is full of
incomparable beauty.</p>

<p>Other names of this later period crowd upon our attention, in political
literature, Mazzini; in the novel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> D'Azeglio, Cantù, Guerazzi, and
Gozzi; in history Botta, Balbo, and Cantù. But we must hasten to close
this brief survey, with merely mentioning the names of a few of the more
important writers of the present time; in poetry, Carducci, Ada Negri,
D'Annunzio; in the novel, which in Italy as elsewhere has usurped the
chief place, Fogazzaro, D'Annunzio. The latter, although still young,
is, next to Carducci, the most considerable figure in Italian literature
to-day. In his dramas, poetry, and novels he shows a wonderful command
of language and descriptive imagination, and at one time bid fair to
become a truly great writer. In his later works he shows retrogression
rather than progress, and the taint of immorality and a certain
exaggerated eccentricity of thought have vitiated his talent and tended
to destroy his popularity.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
